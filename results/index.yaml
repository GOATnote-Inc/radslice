    corpus_note: "IDC open-access DICOM (LIDC-IDRI, NLST, TCGA-LIHC, CMB-CRC); images not condition-matched — screening/research cases, not pathology-specific"
    notes: "First image-backed smoke test. Pipeline validated end-to-end: DICOM load, multimodal inference, cross-vendor judge. 0% pass rate expected — IDC screening images do not exhibit target pathology (e.g., normal CXR for CHF task). Confirms grading correctly penalizes condition mismatch."
