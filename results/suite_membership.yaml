# Suite Membership Tracking
# Tracks which tasks belong to capability vs regression suites.
# Managed by eval-lead agent (proposals from corpus-strategist).

# All 320 tasks start in capability suite.
# Tasks promoted to regression when they discriminate between models.
# Tasks retired from capability when saturated (pass@5 > 0.95 all models, 3+ runs).
