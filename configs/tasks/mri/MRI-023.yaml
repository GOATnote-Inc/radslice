ground_truth:
  primary_diagnosis: "Avascular necrosis (osteonecrosis) of the left femoral head"
  differential:
    - transient osteoporosis of the hip
    - subchondral insufficiency fracture
    - septic arthritis with osteomyelitis
    - bone marrow edema syndrome
  key_findings:
    - { finding: "serpiginous T1 hypointense and T2 hyperintense line (double-line sign) in the femoral head", location: "anterosuperior left femoral head", required: true }
    - { finding: "geographic area of altered marrow signal in the femoral head", location: "left femoral head", required: true }
    - { finding: "subchondral crescent sign indicating subchondral fracture", location: "anterosuperior femoral head articular surface", required: false }
    - { finding: "surrounding bone marrow edema on STIR/T2 fat-sat", location: "left femoral head and neck", required: false }
  severity: moderate
  laterality: left
  negatives:
    - joint effusion with synovial enhancement (favors septic arthritis)
    - diffuse marrow edema without demarcation line (favors transient osteoporosis)
    - femoral head collapse
    - contralateral femoral head involvement

reference_solution: |
  MRI of the left hip demonstrates findings of avascular necrosis (osteonecrosis)
  of the left femoral head. On T1-weighted images, there is a serpiginous
  hypointense line in the anterosuperior femoral head demarcating the necrotic
  segment. On T2-weighted images, this line demonstrates the characteristic
  double-line sign with an outer hypointense line (sclerosis) and inner
  hyperintense line (granulation tissue). The necrotic segment involves
  approximately 30% of the weight-bearing surface of the femoral head. There
  is surrounding bone marrow edema on STIR sequences in the femoral head and
  proximal femoral neck. No definite subchondral collapse or crescent sign is
  identified at this stage. The articular cartilage appears preserved. The
  contralateral femoral head is normal.
  Impression: Left femoral head avascular necrosis with double-line sign,
  Ficat stage II. Orthopedic consultation recommended for staging and
  management, including consideration of core decompression.
