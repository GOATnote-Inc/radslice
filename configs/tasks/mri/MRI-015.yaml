reference_solution: |
  MRI of the cervical spine demonstrates T2 hyperintense signal within the spinal cord at the C5-C6 level indicating cord edema and contusion. Within the area of edema, a focal T2 hypointense focus is present consistent with intramedullary hemorrhage, which is a poor prognostic sign. There is disruption of the posterior ligamentous complex at C5-C6 with interspinous ligament hyperintensity on STIR. No epidural hematoma or complete cord transection. Findings are consistent with acute traumatic spinal cord injury with hemorrhagic contusion.
