  primary_diagnosis: "Cerebral cavernous malformation (cavernoma)"
  differential:
    - hemorrhagic metastasis
    - thrombosed AVM
    - calcified granuloma
    - developmental venous anomaly with hemorrhage
    - amyloid angiopathy-related microhemorrhage
  key_findings:
    - { finding: "popcorn-like lesion with mixed T1 and T2 signal (blood products of varying ages)", location: "right frontal lobe subcortical", required: true }
    - { finding: "complete hemosiderin rim appearing as T2/SWI hypointense ring", location: "periphery of the lesion", required: true }
    - { finding: "no surrounding edema or mass effect", location: "adjacent brain parenchyma", required: false }
    - { finding: "no enhancement or minimal faint enhancement", location: "within and around the lesion", required: false }
  severity: moderate
  laterality: right
  negatives:
    - surrounding vasogenic edema (favors tumor)
    - associated feeding arteries or draining veins (favors AVM)
    - significant contrast enhancement
    - mass effect
    - multiple lesions (if solitary)

reference_solution: |
  MRI of the brain demonstrates a well-circumscribed lesion in the right
  frontal lobe subcortical white matter measuring approximately 1.8 x 1.5 cm.
  The lesion has a characteristic popcorn-like appearance with mixed T1 and T2
  signal intensities reflecting blood products of varying ages (methemoglobin,
  hemosiderin, deoxyhemoglobin). A complete rim of T2 hypointense hemosiderin
  surrounds the lesion, which blooms prominently on SWI sequences. There is no
  significant surrounding vasogenic edema or mass effect, distinguishing this
  from a hemorrhagic neoplasm. Minimal to no contrast enhancement is seen. No
  associated feeding arteries or enlarged draining veins are identified to
  suggest an arteriovenous malformation. An associated developmental venous
  anomaly may be present in the adjacent white matter.
  Impression: Right frontal lobe lesion with imaging characteristics typical
  of a cerebral cavernous malformation (cavernoma), including popcorn
  morphology, mixed-age blood products, and complete hemosiderin rim.
