reference_solution: |
  MRI of the left hip demonstrates a stress fracture of the left femoral neck.
  On T1-weighted coronal images, a linear hypointense fracture line is
  identified in the medial compression side of the femoral neck, oriented
  perpendicular to the femoral neck axis. Surrounding bone marrow edema is
  present on STIR and T2-weighted fat-saturated sequences, manifesting as
  hyperintense signal in the femoral neck and extending into the
  intertrochanteric region. The fracture line is non-displaced with no
  cortical step-off on any sequence. The medial compression-side location is
  favorable for conservative management. No features of avascular necrosis
  (no serpiginous demarcation line or double-line sign). No lytic or
  destructive lesion to suggest pathologic fracture. The articular cartilage
  and femoral head are normal.
  Impression: Non-displaced stress fracture of the left femoral neck
  (compression side). Protected weight-bearing and orthopedic follow-up
  recommended.
