reference_solution: |
  MRI of the abdomen demonstrates a well-circumscribed T2 markedly hyperintense mass arising from the right adrenal gland, measuring approximately 4.5 cm, demonstrating the characteristic "lightbulb sign." The mass shows avid arterial phase enhancement with delayed washout on dynamic post-gadolinium imaging. No signal drop on opposed-phase T1 images, excluding a lipid-rich adenoma. No local invasion of the inferior vena cava or adjacent structures. The left adrenal gland is normal. Findings are characteristic of pheochromocytoma, and biochemical confirmation with plasma metanephrines is recommended prior to any surgical intervention.
