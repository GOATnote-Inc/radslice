reference_solution: |
  MRI of the temporal bones with gadolinium demonstrates enhancing soft tissue in the right external auditory canal extending into the skull base. T1-weighted images show replacement of normal fatty marrow signal in the right temporal bone and petrous apex, with corresponding STIR hyperintensity, consistent with osteomyelitis. Inflammatory tissue extends into the right infratemporal fossa and parapharyngeal space. No intracranial abscess or sigmoid sinus thrombosis. Findings are consistent with malignant otitis externa with skull base osteomyelitis, typically caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa in immunocompromised patients.
