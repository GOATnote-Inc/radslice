reference_solution: |
  Multiparametric MRI of the prostate demonstrates a focal lesion in the left
  peripheral zone at the mid-gland level measuring 1.8 x 1.5 cm. On
  T2-weighted images, the lesion is markedly hypointense compared to the
  normally hyperintense peripheral zone. DWI shows markedly restricted
  diffusion with high signal on b=1400 s/mm2 and corresponding low ADC values
  of approximately 600 um2/s, well below the suspicious threshold. Dynamic
  contrast-enhanced (DCE) imaging demonstrates early focal enhancement
  corresponding to the T2 and diffusion abnormality, classified as DCE
  positive. Per PI-RADS v2.1 criteria, this peripheral zone lesion with focal
  T2 hypointensity greater than 1.5 cm and markedly restricted diffusion
  qualifies as PI-RADS 5 (very high probability of clinically significant
  cancer). There is suggestion of capsular abutment along the left
  posterolateral margin. The seminal vesicles are normal. No pelvic
  lymphadenopathy. No osseous metastatic disease.
  Impression: PI-RADS 5 lesion in the left peripheral zone, highly suspicious
  for clinically significant prostate cancer. MRI-targeted biopsy recommended.
