reference_solution: |
  MRI of the thoracic spine demonstrates longitudinally extensive T2
  hyperintense intramedullary signal abnormality within the thoracic spinal
  cord extending from T4 through T9, spanning approximately 6 vertebral body
  segments. On axial images, the signal abnormality predominantly involves
  the central gray matter with relative sparing of the peripheral white
  matter tracts. There is mild fusiform expansion of the cord at the level
  of the signal abnormality. Post-gadolinium images show patchy areas of
  enhancement within the abnormal cord segment, consistent with active
  inflammation. No extrinsic compression or disc disease. No flow voids
  along the cord surface to suggest a dural AV fistula. The longitudinal
  extent (3 or more segments) raises concern for neuromyelitis optica
  spectrum disorder, and aquaporin-4 antibody testing should be performed.
  Impression: Longitudinally extensive transverse myelitis spanning T4-T9.
  Recommend AQP4-IgG and MOG-IgG antibody testing to evaluate for NMOSD
  versus MOGAD.
