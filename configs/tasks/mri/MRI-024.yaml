reference_solution: |
  MRI of the pelvis demonstrates discontinuity of the anterior myometrial wall at the lower uterine segment, at the site of a prior cesarean scar, consistent with uterine rupture. There is herniation of membranes through the myometrial defect. A T1 hyperintense fluid collection is present in the anterior paravesical space indicating hemoperitoneum. The myometrial edges at the rupture site are irregular with edema. No evidence of bladder wall invasion. Findings are consistent with complete uterine rupture requiring emergent surgical intervention.
