reference_solution: |
  MRI of the brain with diffusion-weighted imaging demonstrates a focal area of restricted diffusion involving the left middle cerebral artery territory, with high signal on DWI and corresponding low signal on the ADC map, consistent with acute ischemic infarction. FLAIR images show early cortical swelling with subtle hyperintensity in the left insular ribbon and frontoparietal cortex. No hemorrhagic transformation or midline shift is present. MRA of the circle of Willis shows loss of normal flow void in the left M1 segment.
