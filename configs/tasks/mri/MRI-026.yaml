reference_solution: |
  MRI of the orbits with DWI and MRA demonstrates restricted diffusion in the retina of the left globe, with high DWI signal and low ADC values consistent with retinal ischemia. MRA of the circle of Willis and orbital vessels shows absence of flow in the left ophthalmic artery, confirming central retinal artery occlusion. The right globe and optic nerve appear normal. No orbital mass or optic nerve enhancement. Findings are consistent with left central retinal artery occlusion, a stroke-equivalent requiring emergent evaluation for embolic source.
