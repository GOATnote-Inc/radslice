reference_solution: |
  MR angiography of the chest demonstrates an intimal flap within the thoracic aorta, separating the true and false lumens. There is differential flow signal on contrast-enhanced MRA with slower flow in the false lumen. The dissection extends from the aortic arch into the descending thoracic aorta, consistent with a Stanford Type B dissection. No pericardial effusion or branch vessel compromise is identified.
