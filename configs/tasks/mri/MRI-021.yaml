reference_solution: |
  MRI of the left hip demonstrates a linear T1 hypointense fracture line traversing the left femoral neck, which was occult on initial radiographs. Surrounding STIR hyperintense marrow edema is present in the femoral neck and intertrochanteric region. The fracture is non-displaced. No avascular necrosis of the femoral head. No significant hip joint effusion. Findings confirm an occult non-displaced femoral neck fracture requiring orthopedic consultation for surgical planning.
