reference_solution: |
  MRI of the brain demonstrates disproportionate ventriculomegaly affecting all
  four ventricles. The Evans index exceeds 0.3, confirming ventriculomegaly.
  Notably, there is a disproportionately enlarged subarachnoid space
  hydrocephalus (DESH) pattern with widened sylvian fissures and tight
  high-convexity sulci, distinguishing this from generalized cerebral atrophy.
  The callosal angle measures approximately 70 degrees on coronal images at the
  level of the posterior commissure. The cerebral aqueduct is patent with a
  prominent flow void on T2-weighted images, suggesting increased CSF pulsatile
  flow. No obstructing lesion is identified. Mild periventricular T2/FLAIR
  signal may represent transependymal CSF migration. The clinical triad of gait
  disturbance, cognitive decline, and urinary incontinence should be correlated.
  Impression: Imaging findings consistent with normal pressure hydrocephalus
  (NPH) with DESH pattern. CSF tap test and neurosurgical shunt evaluation
  recommended.
