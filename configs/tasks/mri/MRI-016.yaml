reference_solution: |
  MRI of the brain demonstrates multiple foci of restricted diffusion at the gray-white matter junction bilaterally on DWI, with corresponding microhemorrhagic foci on SWI sequences involving the corpus callosum splenium and bilateral subcortical white matter, consistent with diffuse axonal injury (DAI grade II-III). A small hemorrhagic contusion is noted at the right temporal pole. No large extra-axial hematoma or significant midline shift. The pattern of injury is characteristic of rotational acceleration-deceleration traumatic brain injury.
