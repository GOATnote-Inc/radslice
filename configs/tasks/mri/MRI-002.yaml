reference_solution: |
  Cardiac MRI with cine SSFP sequences demonstrates an irregular, mobile mass attached to the anterior leaflet of the mitral valve, consistent with a vegetation. Associated moderate mitral regurgitation is noted on cine imaging. Late gadolinium enhancement images show subtle periannular enhancement at the mitral annulus raising concern for early abscess formation. No pericardial effusion. Findings are consistent with infective endocarditis.
