reference_solution: |
  MRI of the brain demonstrates an area of restricted diffusion in the left ACA-MCA watershed zone consistent with acute ischemic stroke. Diffuse calvarial marrow reconversion is noted with T1 hypointense and T2 hyperintense signal replacing normal fatty marrow, characteristic of expanded hematopoietic marrow seen in sickle cell disease. MRA shows stenosis of the bilateral distal internal carotid arteries with moyamoya-pattern collaterals. No hemorrhagic transformation or dural venous sinus thrombosis. Findings are consistent with cerebrovascular complication of sickle cell disease requiring emergent exchange transfusion.
