reference_solution: |
  MRI of the brain with MR venography demonstrates expansion of the right cavernous sinus with abnormal T1 and T2 signal and a filling defect on contrast-enhanced MRV, consistent with cavernous sinus thrombosis. The lateral wall of the right cavernous sinus is convex. The right superior ophthalmic vein is engorged, and there is mild right-sided proptosis. No extension of thrombus into the transverse or sigmoid sinuses is identified. No adjacent parenchymal signal abnormality to suggest venous infarction.
