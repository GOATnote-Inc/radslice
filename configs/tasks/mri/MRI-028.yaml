reference_solution: |
  High-resolution vessel wall MRI demonstrates concentric mural thickening and avid post-gadolinium enhancement of the bilateral superficial temporal arteries on T1 fat-saturated images, with associated luminal narrowing. The vessel wall changes are most prominent on the right. No intracranial vessel wall enhancement or acute infarction. Findings are highly suggestive of giant cell arteritis (temporal arteritis) and should prompt urgent rheumatologic consultation and corticosteroid therapy to prevent vision loss.
