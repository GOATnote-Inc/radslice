reference_solution: |
  MRI of the abdomen with liver protocol demonstrates normal hepatic findings.
  The liver is normal in size and morphology with smooth contour without
  nodularity. The hepatic parenchyma demonstrates homogeneous signal on
  T1-weighted, T2-weighted, and diffusion-weighted sequences without focal
  lesion. On in-phase and opposed-phase chemical shift imaging, there is no
  signal loss to suggest hepatic steatosis. Dynamic post-gadolinium imaging
  shows normal hepatic perfusion without focal enhancement abnormality. The
  portal vein, hepatic veins, and IVC are patent with normal flow. No biliary
  dilatation. The gallbladder is unremarkable. No ascites. The spleen is
  normal in size.
  Impression: Normal liver MRI without focal hepatic lesion, steatosis, or
  cirrhotic morphology.
