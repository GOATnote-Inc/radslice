reference_solution: |
  MRI of the thoracic spine with gadolinium demonstrates a rim-enhancing epidural collection in the posterior epidural space extending from T7 to T10. The collection is T2 hyperintense with restricted diffusion on DWI, consistent with an epidural abscess rather than hematoma. The thoracic spinal cord is displaced ventrally and compressed at T8-T9, though no intramedullary signal abnormality is seen to indicate myelopathy at this time. No adjacent vertebral body osteomyelitis or discitis. Findings are consistent with a spinal epidural abscess requiring emergent neurosurgical decompression and IV antibiotics.
