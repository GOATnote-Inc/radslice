reference_solution: |
  MRI of the brain demonstrates innumerable punctate foci of restricted diffusion scattered diffusely throughout the bilateral cerebral white matter and deep gray nuclei on DWI with corresponding low ADC values, producing the characteristic "starfield" pattern. SWI sequences show scattered petechial susceptibility artifacts in the white matter bilaterally. No large territorial infarction or mass lesion. In the clinical context of recent long bone fracture, findings are pathognomonic for cerebral fat embolism syndrome.
