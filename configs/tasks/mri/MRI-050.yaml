reference_solution: |
  Cardiac MRI with coronary MRA in a pediatric patient demonstrates fusiform dilation of the proximal and mid left anterior descending coronary artery, measuring up to 6 mm in diameter (z-score >10), consistent with a giant coronary artery aneurysm in the setting of Kawasaki disease. T2 mapping shows mildly elevated myocardial T2 values in the left ventricular myocardium suggesting active myocardial inflammation. A small pericardial effusion is present. No coronary artery thrombosis on MRA. No late gadolinium enhancement to indicate myocardial infarction. Findings warrant continued anticoagulation and serial cardiac imaging surveillance.
