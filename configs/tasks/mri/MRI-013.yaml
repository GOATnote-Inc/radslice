reference_solution: |
  MRI of the brain demonstrates a crescent-shaped extra-axial collection along the right frontoparietal convexity, displaying T1 hyperintensity and T2 mixed signal consistent with a subacute subdural hematoma. The collection measures approximately 12 mm in maximal thickness with mass effect causing sulcal effacement and 6 mm of leftward midline shift. No uncal herniation. No underlying parenchymal contusion or enhancing lesion. Findings are consistent with a subacute subdural hematoma warranting neurosurgical evaluation.
