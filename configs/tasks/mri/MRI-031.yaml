ground_truth:
  primary_diagnosis: "Left ovarian endometrioma (chocolate cyst)"
  differential:
    - hemorrhagic ovarian cyst
    - mature cystic teratoma (dermoid cyst)
    - mucinous cystadenoma
    - tubo-ovarian abscess
  key_findings:
    - { finding: "T1 hyperintense cystic adnexal mass that does NOT lose signal on fat-suppressed images (shading sign)", location: "left adnexa / left ovary", required: true }
    - { finding: "homogeneous T2 hypointense signal (T2 shading/dark spot) from chronic blood products", location: "left adnexal mass", required: true }
    - { finding: "no solid enhancing components", location: "within the cystic mass", required: false }
    - { finding: "no signal drop on fat-suppressed sequences (distinguishing from dermoid)", location: "left adnexal mass on fat-suppressed T1 images", required: false }
  severity: moderate
  laterality: left
  negatives:
    - macroscopic fat content (signal drops on fat-sat — would indicate dermoid)
    - solid enhancing mural nodule (would raise concern for endometrioid carcinoma)
    - ascites
    - peritoneal implants

reference_solution: |
  MRI of the pelvis demonstrates a well-circumscribed cystic mass in the left
  adnexa measuring 4.5 x 3.8 cm, arising from the left ovary. The mass is
  T1 hyperintense on non-fat-suppressed sequences; however, critically, it
  retains its high T1 signal on fat-suppressed images, confirming that the T1
  hyperintensity is due to blood products (methemoglobin) rather than fat.
  This is the key distinguishing feature from a dermoid cyst, which loses
  signal on fat suppression. On T2-weighted images, the mass demonstrates
  homogeneous low signal (T2 shading), characteristic of concentrated chronic
  hemorrhagic fluid. No solid enhancing mural nodule is identified on
  post-gadolinium images. The right ovary is normal. No free fluid or
  peritoneal implants are identified. There may be associated deep
  endometriotic implants in the cul-de-sac or uterosacral ligaments.
  Impression: Left ovarian endometrioma with characteristic T1 hyperintensity
  retained on fat suppression and T2 shading. No features of malignant
  transformation.
