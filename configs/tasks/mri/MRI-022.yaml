prompt_template: diagnosis
ground_truth:
  primary_diagnosis: "Left convexity meningioma"
  differential:
    - dural metastasis
    - hemangiopericytoma (solitary fibrous tumor)
    - dural lymphoma
    - granulomatous pachymeningitis
    - plasmacytoma
  key_findings:
    - { finding: "well-defined extra-axial mass with broad dural base and homogeneous intense enhancement", location: "left frontoparietal convexity", required: true }
    - { finding: "dural tail sign (linear enhancement of adjacent dura)", location: "dura adjacent to the mass", required: true }
    - { finding: "T1 isointense and T2 isointense to slightly hyperintense signal relative to gray matter", location: "left convexity mass", required: false }
    - { finding: "CSF cleft between the mass and brain parenchyma confirming extra-axial location", location: "interface between mass and left frontal cortex", required: false }
  severity: moderate
  laterality: left
  negatives:
    - intra-axial location
    - central necrosis or cystic degeneration
    - significant surrounding edema
    - restricted diffusion (would favor lymphoma or atypical meningioma)
    - bone destruction (would favor aggressive lesion)

reference_solution: |
  MRI of the brain with and without gadolinium demonstrates a well-circumscribed
  extra-axial mass along the left frontoparietal convexity measuring 4.0 x
  3.2 x 2.8 cm. The mass has a broad dural base and demonstrates homogeneous
  intense enhancement on post-gadolinium T1-weighted images. A dural tail sign
  is present with linear enhancement of the adjacent dura extending beyond the
  margins of the mass. The mass is isointense to gray matter on T1 and mildly
  hyperintense on T2-weighted images. A CSF cleft is identified between the
  mass and the underlying brain parenchyma, confirming its extra-axial
  location. There is minimal surrounding vasogenic edema. Mild mass effect on
  the adjacent left frontal cortex without significant midline shift. No
  restricted diffusion. No calcification on gradient echo sequences. No bone
  erosion or hyperostosis.
  Impression: Left frontoparietal convexity extra-axial mass with dural tail
  sign, most consistent with a meningioma (WHO grade I). Neurosurgical
  consultation for size-based management.
