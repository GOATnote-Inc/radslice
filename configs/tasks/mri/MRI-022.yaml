reference_solution: |
  MRI of the right knee demonstrates a large complex joint effusion with marked synovial thickening and avid post-gadolinium enhancement, consistent with septic arthritis. Extensive periarticular soft tissue edema is noted on STIR sequences. Subchondral bone marrow edema is present in the distal femoral condyles and proximal tibial plateau, raising concern for early osteomyelitis. No periarticular abscess or drainable collection. No ligamentous or meniscal injury. Urgent joint aspiration is recommended for confirmation and culture.
