reference_solution: |
  MRI of the brain demonstrates bilateral symmetric T2/FLAIR hyperintensity involving the globi pallidi with corresponding restricted diffusion on DWI, consistent with acute necrosis from carbon monoxide poisoning. Additional patchy T2 hyperintensity is present in the bilateral periventricular white matter, suggesting early demyelination (delayed leukoencephalopathy). No hemorrhage within the basal ganglia. No mass lesion. The bilateral globus pallidus involvement is pathognomonic for carbon monoxide toxicity and reflects the vulnerability of these highly metabolically active structures to hypoxic-ischemic injury.
