ground_truth:
  primary_diagnosis: "Transient osteoporosis of the left hip (bone marrow edema syndrome)"
  differential:
    - stress fracture of the femoral neck
    - avascular necrosis of the femoral head
    - septic arthritis with osteomyelitis
    - occult fracture
    - metastatic bone disease
  key_findings:
    - { finding: "diffuse bone marrow edema on STIR/T2 fat-sat without a discrete fracture line", location: "left femoral head and neck", required: true }
    - { finding: "T1 hypointense marrow signal in the femoral head without focal geographic lesion", location: "left femoral head", required: true }
    - { finding: "absence of a linear fracture line on all sequences", location: "left femoral neck and head", required: true }
    - { finding: "small joint effusion", location: "left hip joint", required: false }
  severity: moderate
  laterality: left
  negatives:
    - discrete fracture line (would indicate stress fracture)
    - serpiginous demarcation line (would indicate AVN)
    - destructive lesion or soft tissue mass
    - subchondral collapse
    - contralateral hip involvement

reference_solution: |
  MRI of the left hip demonstrates diffuse bone marrow edema involving the
  left femoral head and extending into the femoral neck. On STIR and T2
  fat-saturated sequences, there is extensive hyperintense signal throughout
  the femoral head and proximal neck. T1-weighted images show corresponding
  diffuse hypointense marrow signal. Critically, no discrete linear fracture
  line is identified on any sequence, which distinguishes this from a stress
  fracture. Similarly, no serpiginous demarcation line or geographic zone
  of necrosis is present to suggest avascular necrosis. A small joint
  effusion is present. No subchondral collapse or cortical irregularity. The
  pattern of diffuse marrow edema centered on the femoral head without a
  fracture line or AVN morphology is characteristic of transient osteoporosis
  of the hip (bone marrow edema syndrome), a self-limiting condition.
  Impression: Transient osteoporosis of the left hip with diffuse femoral
  head marrow edema and no fracture line or AVN morphology. Self-limiting;
  follow-up MRI in 6-8 weeks recommended to confirm resolution.
