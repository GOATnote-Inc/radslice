reference_solution: |
  MRI of the brain demonstrates diffuse cerebral edema with bilateral sulcal effacement and T2/FLAIR hyperintensity. DWI shows multifocal punctate areas of restricted diffusion scattered throughout the bilateral deep white matter and at the cortical-subcortical junction, representing microischemic injury from parasitized erythrocyte sequestration. SWI sequences reveal petechial susceptibility artifacts in the white matter bilaterally. No large territorial infarction or intracranial mass. In the clinical context of confirmed Plasmodium falciparum infection with altered consciousness, findings are characteristic of cerebral malaria.
