reference_solution: |
  Cardiac MRI demonstrates a dilated left ventricle with global hypokinesis and severely reduced ejection fraction estimated at 25-30% on cine SSFP sequences. There is no focal late gadolinium enhancement to suggest myocardial infarction or mid-wall fibrosis pattern to suggest a primary cardiomyopathic process. No intracardiac thrombus is identified. In the clinical context of the peripartum period, findings are consistent with peripartum cardiomyopathy.
