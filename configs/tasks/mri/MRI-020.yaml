reference_solution: |
  MRI of the lumbar spine demonstrates a compression fracture of the L1 vertebral body with loss of approximately 40% of vertebral body height. STIR images show diffuse marrow edema within the L1 vertebral body, confirming acuity. There is retropulsion of the posterior cortex into the spinal canal, causing mild central canal stenosis. No enhancing soft tissue mass or epidural component to suggest pathologic fracture. No adjacent disc space infection. Findings represent an acute compression fracture with posterior cortical retropulsion, constituting a red flag for potential neural compromise.
