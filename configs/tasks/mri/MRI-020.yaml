    - { finding: "cam-type morphology of the femoral head-neck junction", location: "anterolateral femoral head-neck junction", required: false }
  severity: moderate

  negatives:
    - chondral loss or full-thickness cartilage defect
    - femoral head avascular necrosis
    - joint effusion with synovitis
    - stress fracture of femoral neck
    - loose body

reference_solution: |
  MRI of the right hip demonstrates a tear of the anterior-superior acetabular
  labrum. On T2-weighted fat-saturated coronal and sagittal oblique images,
  there is linear hyperintense signal within the labrum at approximately the
  1 o'clock position, extending to the articular surface with detachment of
  the labral base from the acetabular rim. A small paralabral cyst is
  identified anterosuperior to the acetabulum, providing indirect evidence
  of the labral pathology. There is cam-type morphology at the anterolateral
  femoral head-neck junction with an elevated alpha angle, suggesting
  femoroacetabular impingement as the underlying etiology. The articular
  cartilage appears preserved. No avascular necrosis of the femoral head.
  No stress fracture. Small joint effusion is present.
  Impression: Right anterior-superior acetabular labral tear with small
  paralabral cyst, likely related to cam-type femoroacetabular impingement.
