reference_solution: |
  MRCP demonstrates marked dilatation of the intrahepatic and extrahepatic bile ducts with a low-signal filling defect in the distal common bile duct, consistent with an obstructing choledocholithiasis. Periductal T2 hyperintensity and wall thickening of the common bile duct indicate acute inflammatory changes. No intrahepatic abscess or portal vein thrombosis. In the clinical context of Charcot triad (fever, jaundice, right upper quadrant pain), findings are diagnostic of ascending cholangitis secondary to biliary stone obstruction requiring urgent biliary decompression.
