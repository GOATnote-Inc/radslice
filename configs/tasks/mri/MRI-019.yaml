reference_solution: |
  MRI of the abdomen demonstrates a well-circumscribed lesion in the right
  hepatic lobe segment VII measuring 3.5 x 3.0 cm. The lesion is markedly T2
  hyperintense, approaching CSF signal intensity (light bulb sign), and T1
  hypointense relative to hepatic parenchyma. Dynamic post-gadolinium imaging
  shows characteristic peripheral nodular discontinuous enhancement on the
  arterial phase, with progressive centripetal fill-in on the portal venous
  and delayed phases. On 5-minute delayed images, the lesion demonstrates
  near-complete fill-in with enhancement isointense to the blood pool. There
  is no washout appearance. No restricted diffusion on DWI/ADC. These imaging
  features are diagnostic for a hepatic hemangioma and no further workup is
  necessary. The remaining hepatic parenchyma is unremarkable.
  Impression: Hepatic hemangioma in segment VII with classic peripheral nodular
  enhancement and progressive fill-in pattern. Benign, no follow-up required.
