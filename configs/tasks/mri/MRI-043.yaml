reference_solution: |
  MRI of the orbits with gadolinium demonstrates enhancement and thickening of the right ophthalmic (V1) division of the trigeminal nerve extending from Meckel cave through the cavernous sinus to the orbital apex. There is preseptal and postseptal soft tissue inflammatory change in the right periorbital region. Enhancement of the right orbital apex structures, including the extraocular muscles, is noted, raising concern for orbital apex syndrome. No cavernous sinus thrombosis or intracranial abscess. Findings in the clinical context of dermatomal vesicular rash are consistent with herpes zoster ophthalmicus with orbital involvement, requiring IV antiviral therapy and ophthalmologic consultation.
