reference_solution: |
  MRI of the lumbar spine demonstrates a large central disc extrusion at L4-L5, causing severe narrowing of the central spinal canal with compression and crowding of the cauda equina nerve roots. The extruded disc material is T2 hyperintense and extends posteriorly into the central canal. The cauda equina roots are displaced posteriorly and laterally. No abnormal enhancement is seen to suggest infection or neoplasm. The conus medullaris terminates normally at L1 with normal signal. Findings are consistent with cauda equina syndrome requiring emergent surgical decompression.
