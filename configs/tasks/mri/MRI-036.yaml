  key_findings:
    - { finding: "large disc extrusion with epidural component and peripheral enhancement (reactive granulation tissue)", location: "L4-L5 posterior epidural space", required: true }
    - { finding: "contiguity with the parent disc demonstrating disc desiccation", location: "L4-L5 disc space", required: true }
    - { finding: "no restricted diffusion within the epidural component on DWI", location: "epidural collection at L4-L5", required: true }
    - { finding: "normal endplate morphology without erosion", location: "L4 and L5 endplates", required: false }
  severity: moderate
  laterality: ""
  negatives:
    - restricted diffusion within the epidural collection (would favor abscess)
    - endplate erosion or destruction (would favor discitis-osteomyelitis)
    - disc space enhancement (would favor discitis)
    - paraspinal phlegmon
    - fever or elevated inflammatory markers (clinical, not imaging)

reference_solution: |
  MRI of the lumbar spine demonstrates a large disc extrusion at L4-L5 with a
  prominent epidural component extending posteriorly. The extruded disc
  material is contiguous with the desiccated L4-L5 parent disc. On post-
  gadolinium images, there is peripheral enhancement around the disc
  extrusion representing reactive granulation tissue, which can mimic the rim
  enhancement seen with an epidural abscess. However, the critical
  distinguishing feature is the absence of restricted diffusion within the
  epidural component on DWI/ADC, effectively excluding a pyogenic abscess.
  Furthermore, the L4 and L5 endplates demonstrate normal morphology without
  erosion or enhancement, arguing against discitis-osteomyelitis. The disc
  extrusion compresses the traversing L5 nerve roots and causes moderate
  spinal canal stenosis. The remaining lumbar levels are unremarkable.
  Impression: Large L4-L5 disc extrusion with peripheral enhancement
  (reactive granulation tissue), not epidural abscess. Absence of restricted
  diffusion and normal endplates are key distinguishing features.
