ground_truth:
  primary_diagnosis: "Glioblastoma multiforme mimicking brain abscess"
  differential:
    - pyogenic brain abscess
    - brain metastasis
    - primary CNS lymphoma
    - tumefactive demyelination
    - radiation necrosis
  key_findings:
    - { finding: "ring-enhancing lesion with thick irregular enhancing wall", location: "right temporal lobe", required: true }
    - { finding: "absence of central restricted diffusion (facilitated diffusion on DWI/ADC)", location: "core of the lesion", required: true }
    - { finding: "irregular nodular component along the enhancing rim", location: "medial wall of the ring-enhancing lesion", required: false }
    - { finding: "infiltrative T2/FLAIR signal extending beyond the enhancing margin", location: "right temporal and insular cortex", required: false }
  severity: severe
  laterality: right
  negatives:
    - central restricted diffusion (would favor abscess)
    - thin smooth enhancing wall (would favor abscess)
    - dual rim sign on SWI
    - multiple lesions
    - leptomeningeal enhancement

reference_solution: |
  MRI of the brain demonstrates a ring-enhancing lesion in the right temporal
  lobe measuring 4.1 x 3.5 cm. Unlike a typical abscess, the enhancing wall
  is thick and irregular with a nodular component along its medial aspect on
  post-gadolinium T1-weighted images. Critically, the lesional core does NOT
  demonstrate restricted diffusion; rather, DWI shows facilitated diffusion
  with elevated ADC values, effectively excluding a pyogenic abscess. There is
  infiltrative T2/FLAIR signal extending beyond the enhancing margin into the
  right insular cortex and temporal white matter, suggesting a neoplastic
  infiltrating process. The thick irregular wall, absence of central restricted
  diffusion, and infiltrative signal are characteristic of glioblastoma rather
  than abscess. Surrounding vasogenic edema is present with mild mass effect
  on the right temporal horn.
  Impression: Right temporal ring-enhancing mass with imaging features favoring
  glioblastoma over abscess, including thick irregular wall, absence of central
  restricted diffusion, and infiltrative margins. Stereotactic biopsy recommended.
