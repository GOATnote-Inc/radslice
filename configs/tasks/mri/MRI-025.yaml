  key_findings:
    - { finding: "heterogeneous solid renal mass with avid arterial phase enhancement and washout", location: "left kidney, upper pole", required: true }
    - { finding: "loss of signal on opposed-phase compared to in-phase T1 images (intracellular lipid)", location: "within the renal mass", required: true }
    - { finding: "areas of T2 hyperintensity within the mass", location: "left renal mass", required: false }
    - { finding: "tumor thrombus in the left renal vein", location: "left renal vein", required: false }
  severity: severe
  laterality: left
  negatives:
    - macroscopic fat (would suggest angiomyolipoma)
    - calcification
    - bilateral renal masses
    - invasion of the IVC
    - adrenal mass

reference_solution: |
  MRI of the abdomen demonstrates a heterogeneous solid mass arising from the
  upper pole of the left kidney measuring 5.8 x 4.5 x 5.2 cm. The mass is
  predominantly T1 isointense and T2 heterogeneously hyperintense. On chemical
  shift imaging, there is signal loss on opposed-phase relative to in-phase
  images within portions of the mass, indicating intracellular lipid content
  characteristic of clear cell renal cell carcinoma. Dynamic post-gadolinium
  imaging shows avid heterogeneous arterial phase enhancement with washout on
  delayed phases, consistent with a hypervascular renal neoplasm. There is
  extension of tumor thrombus into the left renal vein, which does not extend
  to the IVC. No macroscopic fat is identified to suggest angiomyolipoma. The
  right kidney is normal. No retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy. The ipsilateral
  adrenal gland is normal.
  Impression: Left renal mass with imaging features consistent with clear cell
  renal cell carcinoma with left renal vein tumor thrombus. Surgical
  consultation recommended. Staging chest CT indicated.
