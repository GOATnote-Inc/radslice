reference_solution: |
  MRI of the pelvis demonstrates a markedly distended urinary bladder with thinning of the bladder wall, consistent with acute urinary retention. A large heterogeneous pelvic mass in the retrovesical space is causing extrinsic compression of the bladder outlet. Mild bilateral hydroureteronephrosis is present secondary to the outlet obstruction. No evidence of direct bladder wall invasion by the mass. The findings indicate urinary retention secondary to pelvic mass effect requiring urgent catheterization and further evaluation of the pelvic mass.
