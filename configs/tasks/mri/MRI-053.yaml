reference_solution: |
  MRI of the pelvis demonstrates an enlarged postpartum uterus with heterogeneous intrauterine material showing mixed T1 and T2 signal, consistent with retained products of conception and organized blood products. Dynamic post-gadolinium images reveal a focal avidly enhancing vascular structure within the left myometrium measuring 1.5 cm, consistent with a uterine artery pseudoaneurysm as a source of ongoing hemorrhage. No myometrial discontinuity to suggest uterine rupture. No extrauterine or retroperitoneal hematoma. Findings identify retained products and pseudoaneurysm as treatable causes of postpartum hemorrhage, amenable to uterine artery embolization.
