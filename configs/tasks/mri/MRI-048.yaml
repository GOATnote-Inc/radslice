reference_solution: |
  MRI of the temporal bones demonstrates T2 hyperintense fluid in the right middle ear cavity with associated opacification of the right mastoid air cells. The mastoid septations appear preserved, without evidence of coalescent mastoiditis. Mild mucosal enhancement is noted in the right middle ear on post-gadolinium images. No intracranial complication such as epidural abscess, sigmoid sinus thrombosis, or meningitis. The left middle ear and mastoid are clear. Findings are consistent with acute otitis media with reactive mastoid effusion in a pediatric patient.
