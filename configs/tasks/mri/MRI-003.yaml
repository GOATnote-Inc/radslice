reference_solution: |
  MRI of the brain demonstrates a large heterogeneously enhancing mass
  centered in the right temporoparietal lobe measuring approximately 5.2 x
  4.8 x 4.3 cm. The mass demonstrates thick, irregular peripheral ring
  enhancement on post-gadolinium T1-weighted images with central non-enhancing
  necrosis. The necrotic core is T1 hypointense and T2/FLAIR hyperintense.
  Extensive surrounding vasogenic edema extends through the right cerebral
  hemisphere white matter on T2 and FLAIR sequences. There is mass effect
  with approximately 8 mm leftward midline shift and effacement of the right
  lateral ventricle. DWI shows restricted diffusion along the enhancing
  tumor margin consistent with high cellularity. No definite additional
  enhancing lesions are identified. No leptomeningeal enhancement. MR
  spectroscopy, if performed, would be expected to show elevated choline,
  reduced NAA, and a lactate/lipid peak.
  Impression: Large right temporoparietal enhancing mass with central necrosis
  and surrounding edema, most consistent with glioblastoma multiforme (WHO
  grade IV).
