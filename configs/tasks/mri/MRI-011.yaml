reference_solution: |
  MRI of the thoracic spine demonstrates severe spinal canal stenosis at the T6-T8 level secondary to an enhancing epidural mass with posterior vertebral body involvement, most consistent with epidural metastatic disease. The thoracic spinal cord is significantly compressed with intramedullary T2 hyperintense signal indicating compressive myelopathy. No cord hemorrhage or complete transection. Findings warrant emergent neurosurgical and oncologic consultation.
