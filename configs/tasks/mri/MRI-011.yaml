reference_solution: |
  MRI of the brain demonstrates a ring-enhancing lesion in the left frontal
  lobe subcortical white matter measuring approximately 3.2 x 2.8 cm. The
  lesion shows a thin, smooth enhancing rim on post-gadolinium T1-weighted
  images, distinct from the thick irregular enhancement typically seen with
  neoplasms. Critically, the core of the lesion demonstrates markedly
  restricted diffusion on DWI with corresponding low ADC values, a hallmark
  of pyogenic abscess reflecting viscous purulent material. Surrounding T2/FLAIR
  hyperintense vasogenic edema extends into the adjacent frontal white matter.
  SWI demonstrates a dual rim sign at the abscess wall. No satellite daughter
  abscesses are identified. No ventriculitis or leptomeningeal enhancement.
  The dural venous sinuses are patent.
  Impression: Left frontal ring-enhancing lesion with central restricted
  diffusion, most consistent with pyogenic brain abscess. Neurosurgical
  consultation recommended for aspiration and culture.
