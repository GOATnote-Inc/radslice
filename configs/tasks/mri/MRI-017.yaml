reference_solution: |
  MRI of the abdomen without contrast (performed for suspected appendicitis in pregnancy) demonstrates a dilated, fluid-filled appendix measuring 10 mm in diameter with wall thickening and enhancement-equivalent T2 hyperintensity. Periappendiceal T2 hyperintense fat stranding indicates surrounding inflammation. DWI shows restricted diffusion in the appendiceal wall. No evidence of perforation or periappendiceal abscess. The gravid uterus is displaced superiorly. Findings are consistent with acute uncomplicated appendicitis.
