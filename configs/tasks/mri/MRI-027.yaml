reference_solution: |
  MRI of the orbits demonstrates a T1 hyperintense, T2 heterogeneous collection in the right retrobulbar intraconal space, consistent with acute-to-subacute retrobulbar hemorrhage. The right globe is proptotic with mild tenting of the posterior sclera, indicating elevated intraorbital pressure. The right optic nerve is stretched and displaced. No underlying enhancing mass lesion is identified. The left orbit is normal. Findings represent retrobulbar hemorrhage with compartment syndrome physiology requiring emergent lateral canthotomy and cantholysis to preserve vision.
