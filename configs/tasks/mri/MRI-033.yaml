reference_solution: |
  MRI of the right lower extremity demonstrates diffuse T2/STIR hyperintensity in the subcutaneous tissues and intermuscular fascial planes of the right thigh. The deep fascia is thickened with avid enhancement on post-gadolinium images (fascial enhancement sign), characteristic of necrotizing fasciitis. Areas of non-enhancement within the anterior compartment fascia suggest necrosis. No drainable abscess collection. The extent of fascial involvement is significantly greater than the surface skin changes would suggest. Findings are highly suspicious for necrotizing fasciitis requiring emergent surgical debridement.
