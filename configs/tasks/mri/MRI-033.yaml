reference_solution: |
  MRI of the left ankle demonstrates a complete rupture of the Achilles
  tendon. On sagittal T2-weighted fat-saturated and proton density images,
  there is complete discontinuity of the Achilles tendon approximately 5 cm
  proximal to its calcaneal insertion, within the classic watershed zone of
  relative hypovascularity. A fluid-filled gap of approximately 2.5 cm is
  present between the retracted proximal stump and the distal stump. The
  proximal stump demonstrates a wavy, retracted morphology with surrounding
  hemorrhage and edema in the Kager fat pad. The pre-Achilles fat pad shows
  increased signal consistent with edema. Both tendon stumps are thickened
  and heterogeneous, suggesting pre-existing tendinopathy. The plantaris
  tendon is intact. No calcaneal fracture. The remaining ankle tendons are
  normal.
  Impression: Complete left Achilles tendon rupture with 2.5 cm gap and
  proximal stump retraction. Orthopedic consultation for surgical vs
  conservative management.
