reference_solution: |
  MRI of the right thigh demonstrates T2/STIR hyperintense edema within the biceps femoris muscle at the musculotendinous junction, with a feathery intramuscular pattern consistent with grade II muscle strain (partial tear). A small intramuscular hematoma is noted at the site of partial fiber disruption. The tendon origin is intact. No complete muscle fiber discontinuity or retraction. No osseous injury. Findings are consistent with an acute partial hamstring strain at the musculotendinous junction.
