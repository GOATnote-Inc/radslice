reference_solution: |
  MRI of the abdomen with MRCP demonstrates an enlarged, edematous pancreas with loss of normal T1 hyperintense signal on fat-saturated sequences, consistent with acute pancreatitis. T2-weighted images show peripancreatic fluid collections surrounding the body and tail of the pancreas. MRCP images reveal gallstones within the gallbladder as low-signal filling defects, suggesting a biliary etiology. No definite pancreatic necrosis or main pancreatic duct disruption is identified. Findings are consistent with acute interstitial edematous pancreatitis, likely of gallstone etiology.
