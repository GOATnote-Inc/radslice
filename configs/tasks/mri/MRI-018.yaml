reference_solution: |
  MRI of the thoracic spine demonstrates a pathologic compression fracture of
  the T7 vertebral body with diffuse T1 hypointense and T2 hyperintense
  marrow-replacing signal, consistent with metastatic involvement. There is
  retropulsion of the posterior vertebral body cortex and associated epidural
  soft tissue mass causing severe compression of the thoracic spinal cord at
  this level. The compressed spinal cord demonstrates abnormal intramedullary
  T2 hyperintense signal, which may represent edema or early myelopathy.
  Post-gadolinium images show avid enhancement of the vertebral body lesion
  and epidural component. Additional smaller vertebral body lesions with
  similar marrow signal are identified at T4, T10, and L2, consistent with
  multifocal osseous metastatic disease. The posterior elements at T7 appear
  involved. No paraspinal mass.
  Impression: Metastatic T7 vertebral body compression fracture with epidural
  extension causing severe spinal cord compression and cord signal abnormality.
  Urgent neurosurgical or radiation oncology consultation recommended.
