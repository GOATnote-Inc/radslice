reference_solution: |
  MRI of the brain demonstrates an acute intraparenchymal hematoma centered in the left basal ganglia. The hematoma shows T1 isointensity and T2 hypointensity consistent with the deoxyhemoglobin phase of acute hemorrhage, with marked susceptibility artifact on GRE sequences. Surrounding T2/FLAIR hyperintense vasogenic edema is present. Mild mass effect on the left lateral ventricle is noted without midline shift. No intraventricular extension of hemorrhage. Post-contrast images show no underlying enhancing mass. Findings are most consistent with hypertensive hemorrhagic stroke.
