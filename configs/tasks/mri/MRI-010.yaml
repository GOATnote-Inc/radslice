reference_solution: |
  MRI of the brain with and without gadolinium demonstrates multiple discrete
  ring-enhancing lesions in the bilateral cerebral hemispheres, the largest
  measuring 2.1 cm in the right frontal lobe and 1.8 cm in the left parietal
  lobe. The lesions are located at the gray-white matter junction and
  demonstrate thin, relatively smooth ring enhancement on post-gadolinium
  T1-weighted images with central T1 hypointensity and T2 hyperintensity
  suggesting central necrosis. Each lesion is surrounded by vasogenic edema
  that appears disproportionately large relative to the lesion size, a
  characteristic feature of metastatic disease. The corpus callosum is spared.
  There is no leptomeningeal enhancement to suggest carcinomatosis. No
  hemorrhagic components identified on SWI. Mild mass effect from the right
  frontal lesion without significant midline shift. The multiplicity of
  lesions at the gray-white junction, thin ring enhancement, and relative
  edema all favor metastatic disease over a primary brain neoplasm such as
  glioblastoma, which typically presents as a solitary heterogeneous mass with
  thick irregular enhancement.
  Impression: Multiple ring-enhancing lesions at the gray-white matter
  junction, most consistent with brain metastases. Recommend correlation with
  primary malignancy screening (chest CT, body PET/CT).
