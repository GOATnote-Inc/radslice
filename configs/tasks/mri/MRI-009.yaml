reference_solution: |
  MRI of the lumbar spine with gadolinium demonstrates smooth enhancement of the ventral nerve roots of the cauda equina bilaterally on post-contrast T1-weighted images. There is mild thickening of the involved nerve roots. No spinal cord signal abnormality or compressive lesion is identified. No leptomeningeal nodularity to suggest neoplastic involvement. In the clinical context of ascending weakness with areflexia, findings are characteristic of Guillain-Barre syndrome (acute inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculopathy).
