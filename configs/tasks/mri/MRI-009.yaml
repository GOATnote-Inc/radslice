reference_solution: |
  MRI of the abdomen with liver protocol (dynamic multi-phase post-gadolinium)
  demonstrates a 3.8 cm mass in the right hepatic lobe at the junction of
  segments VI and VII. The mass shows non-rim arterial phase hyperenhancement
  (APHE), followed by non-peripheral washout on the portal venous phase.
  An enhancing capsule is identified on the delayed phase. The lesion is mildly
  T2 hyperintense relative to the background liver and shows mildly restricted
  diffusion. On hepatobiliary phase (if gadoxetate was used), the lesion is
  expected to show hypointensity relative to the enhancing liver parenchyma.
  The background liver demonstrates cirrhotic morphology with nodular contour,
  widened fissures, and caudate lobe hypertrophy. The portal vein is patent.
  No definite additional suspicious lesions. No biliary dilatation. Per
  LI-RADS criteria, this lesion qualifies as LR-5 (definitely HCC) based on
  APHE, washout, and enhancing capsule in a lesion >20 mm.
  Impression: LR-5 lesion in the right hepatic lobe, diagnostic of
  hepatocellular carcinoma, in the setting of cirrhosis.
