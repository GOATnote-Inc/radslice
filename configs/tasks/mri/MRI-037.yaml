reference_solution: |
  MR venography of the left lower extremity demonstrates a filling defect within the left common femoral vein extending into the proximal superficial femoral vein, consistent with deep vein thrombosis. Non-contrast T1-weighted images show hyperintense intraluminal signal within the femoral vein indicating subacute thrombus. STIR images demonstrate perivenous soft tissue edema in the left thigh. No extension of thrombus into the left iliac veins or inferior vena cava. Findings confirm proximal deep vein thrombosis requiring anticoagulation therapy.
