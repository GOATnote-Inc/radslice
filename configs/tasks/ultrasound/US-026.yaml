reference_solution: |
  Right upper quadrant ultrasound demonstrates a distended gallbladder containing multiple echogenic foci with clean posterior acoustic shadowing consistent with cholelithiasis. The gallbladder wall is diffusely thickened measuring 5 mm with a striated (layered) appearance suggesting edema. Pericholecystic fluid is present along the gallbladder fossa. A positive sonographic Murphy sign is elicited with maximal tenderness over the gallbladder fundus during transducer compression. The common bile duct measures 4 mm with no intrahepatic biliary dilation. These findings are consistent with acute calculous cholecystitis.
