reference_solution: |
  Obstetric ultrasound demonstrates a full-thickness myometrial defect along the anterior lower uterine segment at the site of the prior cesarean section scar. Fetal parts are identified protruding through the defect into the extrauterine space. Significant free fluid consistent with hemoperitoneum is present in the pelvis and extending into the abdomen. The fetal heart rate is bradycardic at 80 bpm. These findings are consistent with complete uterine rupture at the prior cesarean scar site, a surgical emergency requiring immediate laparotomy and delivery.
