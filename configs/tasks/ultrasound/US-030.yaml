reference_solution: |
  Musculoskeletal ultrasound of the right first metatarsophalangeal joint demonstrates the double contour sign, with a hyperechoic irregular band on the surface of the articular cartilage representing monosodium urate crystal deposition. There is a moderate joint effusion with synovial hypertrophy demonstrating increased power Doppler signal consistent with active synovitis. Small periarticular echogenic aggregates consistent with microtophi are noted. No cortical erosions are identified. These findings are consistent with acute gouty arthritis of the first MTP joint.
