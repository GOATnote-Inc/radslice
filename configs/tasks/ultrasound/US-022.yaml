reference_solution: |
  Lung ultrasound demonstrates a sonographic consolidation in the right lower lobe with hepatization of the lung parenchyma appearing as a tissue-like echotexture. Dynamic air bronchograms are visible within the consolidated area, indicating patent airways filled with air, which helps distinguish pneumonia from obstructive atelectasis. Surrounding B-lines are present indicating perilesional interstitial edema. A small anechoic parapneumonic pleural effusion is noted. Normal lung sliding is preserved. These findings are consistent with lobar pneumonia involving the right lower lobe.
