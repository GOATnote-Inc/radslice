reference_solution: |
  Pelvic ultrasound demonstrates a markedly distended urinary bladder with an estimated volume of approximately 800 mL. The bladder is thin-walled and filled with anechoic urine without evidence of intraluminal mass, calculi, or wall irregularity. Bilateral mild hydronephrosis is noted, likely secondary to bladder outflow obstruction. The prostate appears mildly enlarged on transabdominal view. These findings are consistent with acute urinary retention, and bladder catheterization is recommended.
