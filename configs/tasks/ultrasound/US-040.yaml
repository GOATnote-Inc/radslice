reference_solution: |
  Transvaginal ultrasound demonstrates an intrauterine gestational sac containing a fetal pole with crown-rump length consistent with 8 weeks gestation. Fetal cardiac activity is present with a heart rate of 155 bpm. A crescentic hypoechoic collection is identified between the gestational sac and the uterine wall consistent with a subchorionic hematoma measuring 3 x 1.5 cm. The internal cervical os is closed. No free fluid is present in the cul-de-sac. These findings are consistent with a viable intrauterine pregnancy complicated by subchorionic hematoma in the setting of threatened abortion.
