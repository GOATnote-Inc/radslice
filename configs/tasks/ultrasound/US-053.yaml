reference_solution: |
  Compression ultrasound of the right lower extremity demonstrates a non-compressible right common femoral vein with echogenic intraluminal thrombus. The vein remains distended and does not coapt with transducer compression. Absent augmentation is noted on distal calf compression. The thrombus extends into the femoral vein in the mid-thigh. Color Doppler confirms absent flow in the thrombosed segments. The right popliteal vein is also non-compressible with intraluminal thrombus. The left lower extremity veins compress normally. These findings are consistent with extensive acute right lower extremity deep vein thrombosis involving the common femoral, femoral, and popliteal veins.
