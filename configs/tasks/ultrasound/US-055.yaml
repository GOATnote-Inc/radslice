reference_solution: |
  Venous duplex ultrasound of the right lower extremity demonstrates a non-compressible great saphenous vein in the mid to distal thigh with echogenic intraluminal thrombus. Surrounding perivascular inflammatory changes are noted with echogenic subcutaneous tissue. The thrombus does not extend to the saphenofemoral junction, which appears patent. The deep venous system is fully compressible with normal augmentation, including the common femoral, femoral, and popliteal veins. These findings are consistent with superficial thrombophlebitis of the right great saphenous vein without deep venous involvement.
