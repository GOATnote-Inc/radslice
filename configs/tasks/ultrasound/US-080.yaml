reference_solution: |
  Transthoracic echocardiography demonstrates concentric left ventricular hypertrophy with the interventricular septum measuring 14 mm and the posterior wall measuring 13 mm. The left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic with an estimated ejection fraction of 70%. Pulsed-wave Doppler of the mitral inflow demonstrates an impaired relaxation pattern with E/A ratio reversal and prolonged deceleration time. Tissue Doppler demonstrates reduced e' velocities with an elevated E/e' ratio of 18, consistent with elevated filling pressures. The left atrium is dilated at 4.5 cm. No aortic stenosis or LVOT obstruction is identified. These findings are consistent with hypertensive heart disease with diastolic dysfunction in the setting of a hypertensive emergency.
