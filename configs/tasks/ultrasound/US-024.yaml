reference_solution: |
  Lung ultrasound demonstrates absent lung sliding along the left anterior chest wall. M-mode imaging reveals the stratosphere (barcode) sign with only parallel horizontal lines and absence of the normal seashore pattern, confirming lack of visceral-parietal pleural apposition. A lung point is identified at the left mid-axillary line in the 4th intercostal space, marking the transition between pneumothorax and normal lung. No B-lines are present in the affected hemithorax. The contralateral right lung demonstrates normal lung sliding with A-lines. These findings are diagnostic of a left-sided pneumothorax.
