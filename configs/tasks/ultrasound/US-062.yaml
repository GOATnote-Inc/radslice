reference_solution: |
  Emergent transthoracic echocardiography demonstrates echogenic swirling material consistent with air bubbles within the right atrium and right ventricle. The right ventricle is acutely dilated with reduced systolic function. The right atrium appears distended with visible air-fluid interface. Moderate tricuspid regurgitation is noted. The left heart chambers appear normal, suggesting no paradoxical air embolism through a patent foramen ovale. The IVC is dilated reflecting acute right heart strain. In the clinical context (central line placement/removal or surgical procedure), these findings are diagnostic of venous air embolism requiring immediate position change to left lateral decubitus with Trendelenburg and consideration of aspiration via central venous catheter.
