reference_solution: |
  eFAST examination following penetrating left chest trauma demonstrates a moderate anechoic fluid collection in the left pleural space above the diaphragm consistent with hemothorax. A small pericardial effusion is identified in the subxiphoid view without evidence of tamponade physiology. Absent lung sliding is noted at the left anterior second intercostal space with a lung point identified laterally, consistent with a concurrent pneumothorax. The FAST abdominal views are negative for free intraperitoneal fluid. These findings indicate hemopneumothorax and hemopericardium requiring emergent chest tube placement and surgical evaluation.
