reference_solution: |
  Ocular ultrasound of the left eye demonstrates an enlarged optic nerve sheath diameter measuring 7.2 mm (normal less than 5 mm), indicating elevated intraocular or intracranial pressure. A heterogeneous retrobulbar collection is identified posterior to the globe consistent with retrobulbar hemorrhage. The globe appears anteriorly displaced (proptosis). Color Doppler demonstrates markedly diminished central retinal artery flow. The right eye appears normal with an optic nerve sheath diameter of 4.3 mm. These findings confirm orbital compartment syndrome from retrobulbar hemorrhage, representing a vision-threatening emergency requiring immediate lateral canthotomy and cantholysis.
