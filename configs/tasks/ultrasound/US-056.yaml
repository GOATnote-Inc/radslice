reference_solution: |
  Abdominal ultrasound demonstrates a well-defined solid mass in the right adrenal gland measuring approximately 5.2 x 4.0 cm with mixed echogenicity and internal hypoechoic areas suggesting cystic degeneration or hemorrhage. Color Doppler reveals prominent internal vascularity. No invasion of the inferior vena cava or right renal vein is identified. The left adrenal gland appears normal. No hepatic metastases are seen. In the clinical context of paroxysmal hypertension with biochemical evidence of catecholamine excess, this adrenal mass is consistent with pheochromocytoma. Cross-sectional imaging with CT or MRI is recommended for further characterization.
