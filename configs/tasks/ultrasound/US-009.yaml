reference_solution: |
  Transthoracic echocardiography demonstrates a severely dilated left ventricle with an end-diastolic dimension of 6.5 cm and diffuse global hypokinesis. The estimated ejection fraction is less than 25%. Moderate functional mitral regurgitation is present secondary to annular dilation. The right ventricle is mildly dilated with reduced systolic function. No intracardiac thrombus is identified. In the context of the peripartum clinical presentation, these findings are consistent with peripartum cardiomyopathy.
