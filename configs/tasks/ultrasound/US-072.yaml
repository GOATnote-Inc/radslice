reference_solution: |
  POCUS assessment in a patient with suspected septic shock demonstrates a hyperdynamic left ventricle with small cavity size and near-obliteration in systole (kissing walls sign), consistent with a hyperkinetic state. The IVC is small measuring 0.8 cm with complete inspiratory collapse, indicating volume depletion and likely fluid responsiveness. Lung ultrasound shows bilateral A-line pattern without significant B-lines. No pericardial effusion or valvular pathology is identified. The LVOT VTI is elevated suggesting high cardiac output despite systemic hypotension. These findings are consistent with the hemodynamic profile of early septic shock with a distributive pattern, supporting aggressive fluid resuscitation and vasopressor therapy.
