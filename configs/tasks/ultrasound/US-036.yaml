reference_solution: |
  Transvaginal ultrasound demonstrates a markedly enlarged right ovary measuring 6.5 x 4.2 cm with a heterogeneous echotexture and peripheral displacement of follicles along the cortex. Color and spectral Doppler reveal absent arterial and venous flow within the right ovary. The twisted vascular pedicle is visualized with a whirlpool sign on the right. A small amount of free fluid is present in the cul-de-sac. The left ovary appears normal in size and morphology with normal Doppler flow. These findings are consistent with right ovarian torsion with complete vascular compromise requiring emergent surgical intervention.
