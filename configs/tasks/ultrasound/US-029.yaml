reference_solution: |
  Abdominal ultrasound demonstrates an enlarged and diffusely hypoechoic pancreas consistent with edematous pancreatitis. A peripancreatic fluid collection is identified anterior to the pancreatic body measuring approximately 3 x 2 cm. Multiple gallstones are present in the gallbladder, and the common bile duct measures 8 mm, suggesting a biliary etiology. No focal pancreatic mass or ductal dilation is identified. The liver parenchyma appears normal. These findings are consistent with acute biliary pancreatitis with early peripancreatic fluid accumulation.
