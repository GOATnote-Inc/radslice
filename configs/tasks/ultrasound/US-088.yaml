reference_solution: |
  Transthoracic echocardiography demonstrates normal left ventricular size and systolic function with an estimated ejection fraction of 60-65%. No regional wall motion abnormalities are identified. The right ventricle is normal in size and function with no evidence of RV dilation or strain to suggest pulmonary embolism. All four cardiac valves appear structurally normal without significant regurgitation or stenosis. No pericardial effusion is present. The IVC is normal in caliber with appropriate respiratory variation. The overall echocardiographic examination is normal, excluding a structural cardiac cause for the patient's symptoms and supporting the clinical diagnosis of a panic attack.
