reference_solution: |
  Transthoracic echocardiography demonstrates a markedly slow ventricular rate of approximately 35 beats per minute on M-mode imaging. Individual left ventricular stroke volumes appear adequate with preserved wall motion, however the overall cardiac output is significantly reduced due to the slow rate. The LVOT VTI is 22 cm but the calculated cardiac output is low at approximately 2.8 L/min. The IVC is dilated at 2.3 cm with less than 50% inspiratory collapse. These findings indicate hemodynamically significant bradycardia with evidence of reduced cardiac output and elevated right-sided filling pressures.
