reference_solution: |
  Abdominal ultrasound of the right lower quadrant in a pediatric patient
  demonstrates a characteristic target sign on transverse imaging, consisting
  of concentric alternating hyperechoic and hypoechoic rings of bowel wall.
  This represents the intussuscipiens enveloping the intussusceptum. On
  longitudinal scanning, a pseudokidney sign is identified with the
  intussuscepted bowel mimicking a renal contour. Centrally trapped mesenteric
  fat appears as hyperechoic material within the intussusceptum. The outer
  diameter of the intussusception measures approximately 3.2 cm. Color Doppler
  demonstrates preserved blood flow within the bowel wall, suggesting viability.
  No free intraperitoneal fluid or pneumoperitoneum is identified. No discrete
  pathologic lead point mass is visualized.
  Impression: Ileocolic intussusception with classic target sign. No evidence
  of perforation or bowel ischemia. Pneumatic or hydrostatic reduction is
  recommended.
