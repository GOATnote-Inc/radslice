reference_solution: |
  Ocular ultrasound with color Doppler of the left eye demonstrates absent color flow in the central retinal artery. A small echogenic focus is identified within the retinal artery at the optic disc, likely representing an embolus. The central retinal vein flow appears preserved. The vitreous is clear without hemorrhage or detachment. The optic nerve sheath diameter is within normal limits at 4.5 mm. The right eye demonstrates normal central retinal artery and vein flow. These findings are consistent with left central retinal artery occlusion, a time-sensitive emergency requiring immediate evaluation and consideration of intra-arterial thrombolysis.
