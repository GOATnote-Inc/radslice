reference_solution: |
  Transthoracic echocardiography demonstrates a flail posterior mitral valve leaflet (P2 segment) with an eccentric posteriorly directed regurgitant jet filling the left atrium on color Doppler. The vena contracta measures greater than 7 mm, consistent with severe mitral regurgitation. Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic with an estimated EF of 65-70%. There is evidence of pulmonary vein systolic flow reversal. These findings indicate acute severe mitral regurgitation, likely from chordal rupture, requiring urgent surgical evaluation.
