reference_solution: |
  Compression ultrasound of the left lower extremity demonstrates a
  non-compressible left common femoral vein with intraluminal echogenic material
  consistent with acute thrombus. The vein is distended and fails to coapt with
  transducer pressure. Color Doppler interrogation shows absent flow within the
  thrombosed segment. Spectral Doppler of the left common femoral vein demonstrates
  no respiratory phasicity or augmentation with distal compression. The left
  superficial femoral, popliteal, and calf veins are patent and compressible. The
  left common femoral artery demonstrates normal triphasic waveforms. No
  inguinal lymphadenopathy or extrinsic mass is identified.
  Impression: Acute deep vein thrombosis of the left common femoral vein.
  Clinical correlation and anticoagulation therapy recommended.
