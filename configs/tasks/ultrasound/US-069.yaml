reference_solution: |
  Abdominal ultrasound demonstrates a thickened and elongated pylorus. The pyloric muscle wall thickness measures 4.5 mm (normal less than 3 mm) and the pyloric channel length measures 18 mm (normal less than 15 mm). The pyloric canal fails to open during the observation period, and no gastric emptying is seen. On transverse view, the characteristic target sign or donut sign is present with the hypertrophied muscle appearing as a hypoechoic ring surrounding the echogenic mucosa. The stomach is fluid-filled and distended. These findings are diagnostic of hypertrophic pyloric stenosis in this infant presenting with projectile non-bilious emesis.
