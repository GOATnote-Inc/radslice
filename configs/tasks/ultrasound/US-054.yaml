reference_solution: |
  Abdominal ultrasound demonstrates splenomegaly with the spleen measuring 18 cm in bipolar length. The splenic parenchyma appears heterogeneous with multiple hypoechoic wedge-shaped areas in the upper pole and hilum, consistent with areas of infarction or acute sequestration. Color Doppler reveals diminished flow in the affected regions. A small amount of free fluid is noted in the splenorenal recess. The liver appears normal. In the clinical context of a patient with known sickle cell disease presenting with acute left upper quadrant pain and dropping hemoglobin, these findings are consistent with acute splenic sequestration crisis.
