reference_solution: |
  Ultrasound of the left knee demonstrates a large complex joint effusion in the suprapatellar recess with internal echoes, debris, and septations, consistent with a complicated effusion rather than simple serous fluid. The synovium is markedly thickened and demonstrates increased power Doppler signal indicating hypervascularity. Periarticular soft tissue edema is present. No periarticular abscess or cortical erosions are identified. In the clinical context of an acutely swollen, erythematous joint with fever, these findings are highly suspicious for septic arthritis and warrant emergent arthrocentesis.
