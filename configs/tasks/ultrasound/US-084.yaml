  POCUS of the right lower leg demonstrates cortical disruption of the tibial diaphysis at the junction of the middle and distal thirds with a visible cortical step-off. The overlying soft tissue is disrupted with a communicating wound tract extending from the skin surface to the fracture site, confirming an open fracture. Surrounding hematoma and soft tissue edema are present. No foreign body is identified within the wound. Color Doppler demonstrates intact posterior tibial artery and dorsalis pedis flow. No features of compartment syndrome are present. These findings confirm an open tibial fracture requiring emergent irrigation and debridement, tetanus prophylaxis, and intravenous antibiotics.
