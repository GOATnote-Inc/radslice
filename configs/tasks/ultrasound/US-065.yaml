reference_solution: |
  Lung ultrasound in a pediatric patient demonstrates diffuse bilateral B-lines in three or more zones per hemithorax, consistent with an interstitial syndrome pattern. The pleural line appears irregular and thickened with multiple small subpleural consolidations measuring 3-5 mm bilaterally, more prominent in the posterior and lateral zones. Normal lung sliding is preserved bilaterally. No significant lobar consolidation or pleural effusion is identified. The A-line pattern is replaced by confluent B-lines. These findings are consistent with bronchiolitis, where lung ultrasound has been shown to have high sensitivity for detecting lower airway inflammation and correlates with disease severity.
