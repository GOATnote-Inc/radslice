reference_solution: |
  Transverse and longitudinal ultrasound of the abdominal aorta demonstrates
  fusiform dilation of the infrarenal segment measuring approximately 5.2 cm in
  maximal anteroposterior diameter, consistent with an abdominal aortic aneurysm
  (AAA). Eccentric mural thrombus is identified along the anterior and lateral
  walls, with a patent residual lumen demonstrating laminar flow on color Doppler
  interrogation. The aortic walls are calcified but intact with no evidence of
  dissection flap or contained rupture. No free intraperitoneal fluid is seen to
  suggest rupture. The iliac arteries, to the extent visualized, appear normal in
  caliber. The suprarenal aorta is not dilated.
  Impression: Large infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm (5.2 cm) with mural
  thrombus. No evidence of rupture. Recommend CTA for surgical planning.
