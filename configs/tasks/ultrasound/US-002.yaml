reference_solution: |
  Duplex ultrasound of the left lower extremity demonstrates echogenic intraluminal thrombus within the superficial femoral artery with absent color and spectral Doppler flow distal to the mid-thigh level. Monophasic dampened waveforms are noted in the common femoral artery proximal to the occlusion. No flow is detected in the popliteal or tibial arteries. The contralateral right lower extremity demonstrates normal triphasic arterial waveforms. Findings are consistent with acute arterial occlusion of the left lower extremity.
