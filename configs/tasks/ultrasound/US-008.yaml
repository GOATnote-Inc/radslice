reference_solution: |
  Transthoracic echocardiography demonstrates a small to moderate circumferential pericardial effusion without echocardiographic evidence of tamponade physiology. The left ventricle appears mildly dilated with globally reduced systolic function and an estimated ejection fraction of 40%. The myocardium appears mildly thickened, which in the appropriate clinical context may represent edema. The pericardium appears echobright. No valvular vegetations are identified. These echocardiographic findings, in conjunction with the clinical presentation, are consistent with acute myopericarditis.
