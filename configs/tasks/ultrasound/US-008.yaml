reference_solution: |
  Ultrasound of the right kidney demonstrates moderate dilation of the renal
  pelvis and calyces, consistent with hydronephrosis. The collecting system
  is fluid-filled and anechoic, with separation of the central renal sinus
  echoes. The calyces appear blunted and rounded. The renal cortex shows
  mild thinning compared to the contralateral kidney. Doppler interrogation
  reveals an elevated resistive index of 0.78 in the right renal artery,
  suggesting obstructive physiology. No obstructing calculus is identified
  at the ureteropelvic junction or distal ureter, though visualization is
  limited. No perinephric fluid collection is present. The left kidney
  appears normal without hydronephrosis.
  Impression: Moderate right-sided hydronephrosis without visible obstructing
  calculus. Elevated resistive index suggests acute obstruction. CT urogram
  recommended for further evaluation.
