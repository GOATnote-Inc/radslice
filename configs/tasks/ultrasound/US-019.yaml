reference_solution: |
  FAST examination is positive for free intraperitoneal fluid. Anechoic fluid is identified in Morison pouch (hepatorenal recess) measuring a stripe of approximately 2 cm. Free fluid is also present in the splenorenal recess and pelvis. The IVC is flat and completely collapses with respiration, consistent with hypovolemia. No pericardial effusion is identified. Lung sliding is present bilaterally. In the setting of blunt abdominal trauma with hemodynamic instability, these findings indicate significant hemoperitoneum consistent with hemorrhagic shock.
