reference_solution: |
  POCUS of the abdominal aorta demonstrates a fusiform infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm measuring 7.2 cm in maximal transverse diameter. Eccentric mural thrombus is identified within the aneurysm sac. There is irregular contour of the posterior aortic wall with a hypoechoic periaortic collection consistent with retroperitoneal hematoma. Free fluid is identified in the pelvis and Morison pouch. In the setting of hemodynamic instability, these findings are consistent with ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm requiring emergent vascular surgery consultation.
