reference_solution: |
  Ultrasound of the thyroid gland demonstrates a solid hypoechoic nodule in the
  right thyroid lobe measuring 1.8 x 1.5 x 1.2 cm. The nodule has irregular
  margins with scattered microcalcifications appearing as punctate hyperechoic
  foci without posterior acoustic shadowing. The nodule demonstrates a
  taller-than-wide orientation on transverse imaging. Color Doppler shows
  increased internal vascularity. No extrathyroidal extension is identified.
  The left thyroid lobe is homogeneous without focal nodule. No suspicious
  cervical lymphadenopathy is seen in the lateral neck compartments. The
  isthmus is normal in thickness.
  Impression: Suspicious right thyroid nodule (ACR TI-RADS 4) with hypoechoic
  composition, irregular margins, and microcalcifications. Fine-needle
  aspiration biopsy is recommended.
