reference_solution: |
  Transesophageal echocardiography reveals an intimal flap at the aortic isthmus just distal to the left subclavian artery origin. A contained pseudoaneurysm is identified with a periaortic hematoma measuring approximately 1.5 cm. Color Doppler demonstrates flow disturbance at the injury site. eFAST examination reveals a moderate left hemothorax. No ascending aortic involvement or pericardial effusion is identified. These findings are consistent with a traumatic aortic injury (grade III) at the isthmus, the most common site for blunt aortic transection, requiring urgent thoracic endovascular repair.
