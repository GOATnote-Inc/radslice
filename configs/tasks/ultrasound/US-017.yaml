reference_solution: |
  Complete right upper quadrant ultrasound demonstrates a normal-appearing
  liver with homogeneous parenchymal echogenicity and smooth hepatic contour.
  No focal hepatic lesion, mass, or cystic structure is identified. The portal
  vein is patent with hepatopetal flow. The hepatic veins are normal in caliber.
  The gallbladder is well-distended with anechoic bile, thin wall measuring
  less than 3 mm, and no intraluminal calculi, sludge, or polyps. The common
  bile duct measures 4 mm and is not dilated. No intrahepatic biliary dilation
  is present. The right kidney is visualized and appears normal. No ascites or
  splenomegaly is detected.
  Impression: Normal right upper quadrant ultrasound. No hepatic, biliary,
  or gallbladder abnormality.
