reference_solution: |
  Right upper quadrant ultrasound demonstrates a distended gallbladder with
  diffuse wall thickening measuring approximately 6 mm, exceeding the normal
  threshold of 3 mm. A small amount of pericholecystic fluid is noted
  surrounding the gallbladder fundus and body. A hyperechoic focus with
  posterior acoustic shadowing is identified at the gallbladder neck, consistent
  with an impacted calculus. The sonographic Murphy sign is positive, with focal
  tenderness elicited upon transducer pressure over the gallbladder. The common
  bile duct measures 4 mm and is not dilated. No intrahepatic biliary dilation
  is present. The adjacent hepatic parenchyma is unremarkable.
  Impression: Acute calculous cholecystitis with gallbladder wall thickening,
  pericholecystic fluid, and positive sonographic Murphy sign. Surgical
  consultation recommended.
