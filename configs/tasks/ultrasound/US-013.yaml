reference_solution: |
  Transthoracic echocardiography demonstrates subtle hypokinesis of the inferolateral wall segments during the symptomatic episode. The overall left ventricular systolic function is preserved with an estimated ejection fraction of 50-55%. The myocardial wall thickness is normal without evidence of chronic thinning or remodeling. No significant valvular abnormalities are detected. In the context of acute chest pain with dynamic ECG changes and elevated troponin trend, these echocardiographic findings support the diagnosis of an acute coronary syndrome and warrant further evaluation with coronary angiography.
