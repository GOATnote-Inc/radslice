reference_solution: |
  Abdominal ultrasound in a pediatric patient demonstrates a characteristic target sign in the right lower quadrant, consisting of concentric alternating rings of echogenic and hypoechoic tissue representing the intussuscepted bowel layers. On longitudinal view, the pseudokidney sign is identified with the intussusceptum extending from the right lower quadrant toward the hepatic flexure. Echogenic mesenteric fat and small lymph nodes are trapped within the intussusception. A small amount of free fluid surrounds the mass. No evidence of bowel wall ischemia (preserved vascularity on Doppler) or perforation is identified. These findings are diagnostic of ileocolic intussusception, and pneumatic or hydrostatic reduction should be considered.
