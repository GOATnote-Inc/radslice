reference_solution: |
  Transthoracic echocardiography demonstrates acute right ventricular dilation with an RV/LV ratio of 1.3 in the apical four-chamber view. There is right ventricular free wall hypokinesis with preserved apical contractility (McConnell sign), a finding associated with acute right heart strain from embolic obstruction. The interventricular septum is flattened and bows toward the left ventricle during systole (D-sign). Tricuspid regurgitation is present with an estimated RVSP of 55 mmHg. Left ventricular function is preserved. In the post-long bone fracture clinical context, these findings are consistent with fat embolism syndrome causing acute cor pulmonale.
