reference_solution: |
  Compression ultrasound of the left lower extremity demonstrates complete
  compressibility of all interrogated deep venous segments, including the
  common femoral vein, femoral vein (superficial femoral vein), popliteal
  vein, and posterior tibial veins. The veins fully coapt with transducer
  pressure. Spectral Doppler of the common femoral vein shows normal
  spontaneous phasic flow with respiratory variation. Augmentation is
  present in the popliteal and femoral veins with distal calf compression.
  No intraluminal echogenic material is identified to suggest thrombus. No
  Baker cyst or other popliteal fossa abnormality is seen. The superficial
  venous system appears unremarkable.
  Impression: Negative compression ultrasound of the left lower extremity.
  No evidence of deep vein thrombosis.
