reference_solution: |
  Pelvic ultrasound in a postpartum patient with ongoing hemorrhage demonstrates heterogeneous echogenic material within the endometrial cavity measuring approximately 4 x 3 cm, consistent with retained products of conception. Color Doppler demonstrates increased vascularity at the placental implantation site along the anterior uterine wall. The uterus appears subinvoluted. The endometrial cavity is distended with echogenic fluid consistent with blood products. No focal arteriovenous malformation is identified. These findings indicate retained products of conception as the likely etiology of the postpartum hemorrhage, warranting uterine evacuation.
