reference_solution: |
  Renal ultrasound demonstrates a 9 mm echogenic focus with clean posterior acoustic shadowing at the left ureteropelvic junction, consistent with a renal calculus. The twinkling artifact is present on color Doppler, confirming a true calcification. There is moderate left-sided hydronephrosis with dilation of the renal pelvis and calyces. The left renal parenchyma is preserved without thinning. Bladder Doppler demonstrates an absent ureteral jet on the left side, supporting a complete left-sided obstruction. The right kidney is normal in size and echogenicity without hydronephrosis. These findings are consistent with obstructive left urolithiasis.
