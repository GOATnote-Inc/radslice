reference_solution: |
  Obstetric ultrasound demonstrates a single intrauterine pregnancy with estimated fetal weight below the 5th percentile for gestational age consistent with fetal growth restriction. Umbilical artery Doppler reveals absent end-diastolic flow, indicating significant placental insufficiency. The amniotic fluid index is reduced at 4 cm, consistent with oligohydramnios. Uterine artery Doppler demonstrates bilateral notching with elevated pulsatility indices. In the setting of maternal seizure activity with severe hypertension, these findings are consistent with eclampsia with placental insufficiency and fetal compromise requiring emergent delivery.
