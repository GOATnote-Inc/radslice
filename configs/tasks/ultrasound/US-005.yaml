reference_solution: |
  Transthoracic echocardiography demonstrates an irregularly irregular ventricular rhythm consistent with atrial fibrillation. The left atrium is dilated measuring 4.8 cm in the parasternal long axis view. Mitral inflow Doppler shows variable E-wave velocities with absent A-waves, confirming loss of organized atrial contraction. Left ventricular systolic function is preserved with an estimated EF of 50-55%. No significant valvular pathology is identified. These findings are consistent with atrial fibrillation with evidence of chronicity given the left atrial enlargement.
