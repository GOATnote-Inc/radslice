reference_solution: |
  Abdominal ultrasound of the liver demonstrates a subcapsular hypoechoic to mixed echogenicity fluid collection along the anterior and lateral surface of the right hepatic lobe measuring approximately 8 x 3 cm, consistent with a subcapsular hepatic hematoma. The liver parenchyma appears heterogeneous with periportal hyperechogenicity suggestive of edema. A small amount of perihepatic free fluid is present. No focal parenchymal mass is identified. In the context of a pregnant patient with thrombocytopenia, hemolysis, and elevated liver enzymes, these findings are consistent with HELLP syndrome complicated by hepatic hemorrhage.
