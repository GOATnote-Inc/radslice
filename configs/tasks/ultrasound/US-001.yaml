reference_solution: |
  Right upper quadrant ultrasound demonstrates a hyperechoic intraluminal focus
  within the gallbladder lumen, consistent with a gallstone. The calculus produces
  clean posterior acoustic shadowing, confirming its calcified composition. The
  stone is gravity-dependent, lying in the gallbladder fundus. The gallbladder
  wall measures within normal limits with no thickening or edema. There is no
  pericholecystic fluid collection. The common bile duct is not dilated. No
  sonographic Murphy sign was elicited.
  Impression: Cholelithiasis without evidence of acute cholecystitis.
