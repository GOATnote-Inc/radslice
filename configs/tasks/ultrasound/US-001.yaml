reference_solution: |
  Bedside transthoracic echocardiography demonstrates a dilated left ventricle with globally reduced systolic function and an estimated ejection fraction of less than 30%. The IVC is dilated at 2.4 cm with less than 50% inspiratory collapse, consistent with elevated right atrial pressure. Lung ultrasound reveals diffuse bilateral B-lines in three or more zones bilaterally, indicating pulmonary interstitial edema. These findings are consistent with acute decompensated heart failure.
