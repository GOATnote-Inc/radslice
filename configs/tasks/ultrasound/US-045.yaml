reference_solution: |
  Renal ultrasound demonstrates an enlarged left kidney measuring 13.5 cm in bipolar length with diffuse loss of normal corticomedullary differentiation. Focal hypoechoic wedge-shaped areas are noted in the upper pole cortex, consistent with areas of focal nephritis. The perinephric fat appears echogenic, suggesting perinephric inflammatory changes. Doppler assessment reveals elevated resistive indices (RI 0.78) in the left kidney. No hydronephrosis, abscess, or calculi are identified. The right kidney appears normal. These findings are consistent with acute left pyelonephritis.
