reference_solution: |
  Intraoral point-of-care ultrasound using a high-frequency endocavitary transducer demonstrates a well-defined hypoechoic collection measuring 2.5 x 1.8 cm in the left peritonsillar space, consistent with an abscess. The collection is located superficial and medial to the internal carotid artery, which is identified pulsating approximately 2 cm deep to the abscess wall, confirming safe distance for aspiration. The surrounding soft tissues demonstrate increased echogenicity consistent with inflammatory changes. The contralateral right side appears normal. These findings confirm a left peritonsillar abscess amenable to needle aspiration or incision and drainage.
