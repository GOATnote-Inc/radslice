reference_solution: |
  eFAST examination in a blast injury victim demonstrates free intraperitoneal fluid in Morison pouch, the splenorenal recess, and the pelvis, consistent with significant hemoperitoneum. Absent lung sliding is identified on the left anterior chest with a barcode sign on M-mode, consistent with a left pneumothorax. Small bilateral pleural effusions are noted. A trace pericardial effusion is present without tamponade physiology. The combination of positive abdominal FAST with pneumothorax is consistent with primary and secondary blast injury. These findings warrant emergent left chest tube placement and surgical evaluation for abdominal hemorrhage.
