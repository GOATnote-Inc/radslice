reference_solution: |
  Transthoracic echocardiography in a febrile pediatric patient demonstrates dilation of the left main coronary artery with a focal aneurysm measuring 5 mm (Z-score 3.8). The coronary artery walls appear echobright, suggesting inflammation. The proximal right coronary artery is also dilated measuring 4 mm (Z-score 2.7). Mild mitral regurgitation is noted. Left ventricular systolic function is preserved with an estimated ejection fraction of 60%. No pericardial effusion is identified. These echocardiographic findings of coronary artery aneurysms, in the clinical context of prolonged fever with mucocutaneous features, are diagnostic of Kawasaki disease and indicate need for immediate IVIG therapy and aspirin.
