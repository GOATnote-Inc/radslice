reference_solution: |
  Carotid duplex ultrasound demonstrates a heterogeneous echogenic plaque at the origin of the left internal carotid artery causing greater than 70% diameter stenosis by NASCET criteria. Peak systolic velocity within the stenosis measures 285 cm/s with an end-diastolic velocity of 110 cm/s. The ICA/CCA ratio is 4.5. Color Doppler shows aliasing and post-stenotic turbulence. The right carotid system demonstrates no hemodynamically significant stenosis. These findings indicate severe left internal carotid artery stenosis, which in the setting of acute neurological deficit is consistent with a symptomatic high-grade stenosis warranting emergent evaluation for intervention.
