reference_solution: |
  Renal ultrasound demonstrates moderate right-sided hydronephrosis with dilation of the renal pelvis and calyces. Echogenic layering debris is identified within the dilated collecting system, consistent with pyonephrosis. The renal parenchyma appears edematous with loss of normal corticomedullary differentiation. The right proximal ureter is dilated. No obstructing calculus is visualized, though distal ureteral visualization is limited by bowel gas. The left kidney appears normal. In the setting of fever and positive urinalysis, these findings indicate a complicated urinary tract infection with pyonephrosis requiring urgent urologic decompression.
