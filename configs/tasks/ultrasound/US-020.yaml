reference_solution: |
  FAST examination demonstrates complex echogenic free fluid in the pelvis within the rectovesical pouch, consistent with hemoperitoneum. The fluid contains internal echoes suggesting hemorrhagic rather than simple ascitic fluid. No free fluid is identified in Morison pouch or the splenorenal recess. The IVC is small and collapsible, consistent with reduced intravascular volume. No pericardial effusion is seen. In the context of blunt pelvic trauma with hemodynamic instability, these findings indicate pelvic hemorrhage, likely from pelvic fracture with associated vascular injury.
