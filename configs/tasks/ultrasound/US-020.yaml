reference_solution: |
  Musculoskeletal ultrasound of the right shoulder demonstrates a
  full-thickness tear of the supraspinatus tendon. A focal hypoechoic defect
  is identified extending from the bursal surface to the articular surface
  of the tendon at its insertion on the greater tuberosity. The cartilage
  interface sign is present, with the deltoid muscle directly contacting the
  humeral head cartilage through the torn tendon gap. The tear measures
  approximately 1.5 cm in the anteroposterior dimension. A small amount of
  anechoic fluid is seen in the subacromial-subdeltoid bursa. Dynamic
  examination confirms the defect does not fill with tendon during abduction.
  The biceps long head tendon is located within the bicipital groove and
  appears intact. The infraspinatus and subscapularis tendons are intact.
  Impression: Full-thickness supraspinatus tendon tear measuring 1.5 cm
  with associated subacromial-subdeltoid bursal fluid. Orthopedic referral
  or MRI for surgical planning is recommended.
