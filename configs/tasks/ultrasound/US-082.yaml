reference_solution: |
  Soft tissue ultrasound of the left lower extremity demonstrates thickened and irregular deep fascia with perifascial fluid tracking along the intermuscular planes. Echogenic foci with dirty posterior acoustic shadowing are identified within the subcutaneous tissue and along the fascial planes, consistent with subcutaneous gas. Diffuse cobblestoning of the subcutaneous fat indicates extensive cellulitis. No discrete drainable abscess is identified. The changes extend over a significant length of the extremity. These findings of fascial thickening, fluid tracking, and subcutaneous gas are highly suspicious for necrotizing fasciitis and warrant emergent surgical exploration and debridement.
