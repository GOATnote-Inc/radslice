reference_solution: |
  Point-of-care ultrasound of the left hip demonstrates anterior intracapsular fluid collection measuring 8 mm of capsular distension, compared to 3 mm on the normal contralateral right hip, consistent with hemarthrosis. Along the anterior femoral neck, a cortical irregularity with step-off is identified, suggesting a fracture line. The contralateral right hip demonstrates normal capsular appearance and smooth cortical surface. In the clinical context of a fall with hip pain and shortened externally rotated extremity, these ultrasound findings support the diagnosis of a left femoral neck fracture. Radiographic and/or CT confirmation is recommended.
