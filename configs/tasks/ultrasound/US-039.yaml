reference_solution: |
  Obstetric ultrasound demonstrates severe oligohydramnios with an amniotic fluid index of 2.5 cm and the largest vertical pocket measuring 1.2 cm. The fetus demonstrates appropriate interval growth and fetal anatomy survey reveals normal bilateral kidneys with visible bladder, excluding a renal etiology for the reduced fluid. Fetal heart rate tracing is reassuring. The placenta is normally positioned without evidence of abruption. In the context of clinical history of vaginal fluid leakage in a preterm pregnancy, these findings are consistent with preterm premature rupture of membranes.
