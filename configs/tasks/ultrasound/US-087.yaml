reference_solution: |
  Transcranial Doppler assessment and optic nerve sheath diameter measurement are within normal limits. The bilateral optic nerve sheath diameters measure 4.2 mm (right) and 4.0 mm (left), within the normal range of less than 5 mm, making elevated intracranial pressure unlikely. Middle cerebral artery velocities are symmetric and within normal limits with normal pulsatility indices, excluding vasospasm or significant intracranial flow disturbance. No midline shift is detected. In a patient presenting with bilateral pressing headache without neurological deficits and normal POCUS assessment, the findings support a diagnosis of tension-type headache without evidence of secondary intracranial pathology.
