reference_solution: |
  Transthoracic echocardiography demonstrates an oscillating, irregularly shaped echogenic mass measuring approximately 12 x 8 mm attached to the atrial surface of the anterior mitral valve leaflet, consistent with a vegetation. Color Doppler reveals moderate to severe mitral regurgitation with an eccentric jet directed posterolaterally. The leaflet appears thickened with possible early perforation. No aortic valve vegetations are identified. Left ventricular systolic function is preserved. These findings are highly suggestive of infective endocarditis involving the mitral valve. TEE is recommended for further characterization and assessment for paravalvular abscess.
