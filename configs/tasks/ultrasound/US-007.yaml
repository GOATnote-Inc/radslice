reference_solution: |
  Ultrasound of the right upper quadrant demonstrates a normal-appearing liver
  with homogeneous parenchymal echogenicity. The hepatic echogenicity is
  isoechoic to the adjacent right renal cortex without increased brightness
  to suggest steatosis. The liver contour is smooth and regular. The hepatic
  vasculature is well-visualized with patent hepatic veins draining normally
  into the inferior vena cava. The portal vein is patent with hepatopetal
  flow and measures within normal limits. No focal hepatic lesion, mass, or
  cystic structure is identified. The intrahepatic and extrahepatic bile ducts
  are not dilated. No ascites or splenomegaly is present.
  Impression: Normal hepatic ultrasound. No steatosis, focal lesion, or
  biliary abnormality.
