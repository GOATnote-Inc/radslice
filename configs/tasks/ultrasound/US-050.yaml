reference_solution: |
  Ocular ultrasound of the right eye demonstrates a highly reflective echogenic membrane in the posterior vitreous cavity, tethered to the optic disc posteriorly and extending peripherally toward the ora serrata, consistent with retinal detachment. The detached retina demonstrates undulating aftermovement with eye movements. Subretinal anechoic fluid is noted between the retina and the choroid. The configuration approaches a V-shape suggesting near-total detachment. No vitreous hemorrhage or intraocular foreign body is identified. The globe contour is normal. These findings are consistent with a retinal detachment requiring urgent ophthalmologic evaluation for surgical repair.
