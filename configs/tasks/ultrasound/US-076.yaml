reference_solution: |
  Musculoskeletal ultrasound of the right posterior calf demonstrates a hypoechoic area at the medial gastrocnemius myotendinous junction measuring approximately 3.5 x 1.5 cm, consistent with a partial-thickness muscle tear (grade 2 strain). There is disruption of the normal fibrillar muscle architecture at this site. A small surrounding intramuscular and intermuscular hematoma is noted tracking along the fascial plane. The overall continuity of the gastrocnemius-Achilles tendon unit is maintained. No complete rupture is identified. The Achilles tendon appears intact. These findings are consistent with an acute grade 2 medial gastrocnemius strain (tennis leg).
