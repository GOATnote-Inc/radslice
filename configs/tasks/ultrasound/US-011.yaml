reference_solution: |
  Transthoracic echocardiography demonstrates a regional wall motion abnormality involving the mid-anterior and anterolateral segments, consistent with the LAD/LCx territory. The affected segments show akinesis. The remaining wall segments contract normally with an overall estimated ejection fraction of 45-50%. No left ventricular thrombus is identified. The valves are structurally normal. In a young patient without traditional atherosclerotic risk factors, these findings raise concern for spontaneous coronary artery dissection, and coronary angiography is warranted for definitive diagnosis.
