reference_solution: |
  Transesophageal echocardiography demonstrates a well-defined intimal flap within the ascending aorta creating distinct true and false lumens. The intimal flap is mobile and oscillates with the cardiac cycle. Color Doppler reveals flow in both lumens with the true lumen demonstrating higher velocity systolic flow. Moderate aortic regurgitation is noted. A small pericardial effusion is present without echocardiographic evidence of tamponade. These findings are diagnostic of Stanford Type A aortic dissection requiring emergent surgical repair.
