reference_solution: |
  Right upper quadrant ultrasound demonstrates a normal-appearing gallbladder.
  The gallbladder is well-distended and contains anechoic, echo-free bile without
  intraluminal calculi, sludge, or polyps. The gallbladder wall is thin and
  smooth, measuring less than 3 mm in thickness, with no mural edema or
  hyperemia. There is no pericholecystic fluid collection. The common bile duct
  measures within normal limits and is not dilated. The adjacent liver parenchyma
  appears homogeneous without focal lesion. No sonographic Murphy sign was
  elicited.
  Impression: Normal gallbladder sonogram. No cholelithiasis, cholecystitis,
  or biliary obstruction.
