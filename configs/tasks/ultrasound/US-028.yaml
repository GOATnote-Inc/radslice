reference_solution: |
  Abdominal ultrasound reveals diffusely fluid-filled small bowel loops with heterogeneous intraluminal content, which may represent blood products in the appropriate clinical context. The IVC is flat measuring less than 1 cm with complete inspiratory collapse, indicating significant intravascular volume depletion consistent with hemorrhagic shock physiology. The abdominal aorta is normal in caliber, excluding aortic pathology as a cause. A small amount of free pelvic fluid is noted. These findings, in conjunction with the clinical presentation of melena and hemodynamic instability, support the diagnosis of significant gastrointestinal hemorrhage.
