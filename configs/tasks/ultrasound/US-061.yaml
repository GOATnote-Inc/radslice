reference_solution: |
  POCUS assessment in a patient with non-compressible torso hemorrhage demonstrates a massively positive FAST with free fluid in all quadrants. The IVC is flat and collapsing. POCUS-guided confirmation of REBOA catheter placement shows the balloon tip in the Zone 1 (descending thoracic/supraceliac) aortic position. Following balloon inflation, Doppler interrogation of the infrarenal aorta demonstrates absent flow, confirming effective aortic occlusion. Cardiac POCUS shows a hyperdynamic, underfilled left ventricle. These findings confirm appropriate REBOA placement for temporary hemorrhage control pending definitive surgical management.
