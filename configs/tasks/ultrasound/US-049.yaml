reference_solution: |
  Ocular ultrasound of the left eye (performed with minimal transducer pressure due to clinical concern for open globe) demonstrates an irregular globe contour with flattening of the anterior chamber. Dense echogenic material fills the vitreous cavity consistent with vitreous hemorrhage. The globe appears smaller in volume compared to the normal contralateral right eye. The lens position cannot be clearly delineated. No obvious intraocular foreign body is identified. Caution: ultrasound in suspected open globe is relatively contraindicated and should only be performed if the diagnosis would change management. These findings are consistent with an open globe injury requiring emergent ophthalmologic surgical repair.
