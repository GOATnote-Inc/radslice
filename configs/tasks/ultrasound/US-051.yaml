reference_solution: |
  High-frequency linear ultrasound of the bilateral superficial temporal arteries demonstrates the halo sign bilaterally, characterized by hypoechoic circumferential wall thickening surrounding the vessel lumen. The halo measures approximately 0.7 mm in thickness. The temporal arteries are non-compressible with the compression sign positive bilaterally. Doppler interrogation reveals turbulent flow with mildly elevated peak systolic velocities but no complete occlusion. The axillary arteries show no involvement. These findings have a high positive predictive value for giant cell arteritis and, in the appropriate clinical context, support initiation of high-dose corticosteroids without delay.
