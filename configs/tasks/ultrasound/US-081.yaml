reference_solution: |
  Paravertebral ultrasound of the lumbar spine demonstrates a hypoechoic collection in the posterior epidural space at the L3-L4 level, causing narrowing of the spinal canal. The normal anechoic CSF space within the thecal sac appears effaced at this level. Paraspinal muscle edema is noted in the adjacent erector spinae. On abdominal screening, the aorta measures normal at 1.8 cm, excluding AAA as a cause of back pain. In the context of acute back pain with red flag features (saddle anesthesia, urinary retention, progressive weakness), these ultrasound findings suggest an epidural collection with potential cauda equina compromise, warranting emergent MRI and neurosurgical consultation.
