reference_solution: |
  Transthoracic echocardiography demonstrates akinesis of the mid to distal anterior septum, anterior wall, and apex of the left ventricle consistent with the LAD coronary artery territory. The remaining myocardial segments demonstrate normal or compensatory hyperkinesis. The overall left ventricular ejection fraction is estimated at 35%. No acute mechanical complications are identified, specifically no ventricular septal defect, free wall rupture, or papillary muscle dysfunction. No LV apical thrombus is seen. These findings are consistent with an acute anterior STEMI and support emergent reperfusion therapy.
