reference_solution: |
  Right upper quadrant ultrasound demonstrates significant dilation of the common bile duct measuring 12 mm, well above the upper limit of normal. There is associated intrahepatic biliary ductal dilation with the parallel channel (shotgun) sign in the liver. A shadowing echogenic focus is identified in the distal common bile duct consistent with choledocholithiasis. The gallbladder is distended with wall edema. In the clinical context of Charcot triad (fever, jaundice, right upper quadrant pain), these findings are consistent with acute ascending cholangitis secondary to choledocholithiasis requiring emergent biliary decompression.
