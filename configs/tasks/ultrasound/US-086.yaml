reference_solution: |
  Perineal and scrotal ultrasound demonstrates extensive subcutaneous gas within the perineal and scrotal soft tissues, manifested as echogenic foci with dirty posterior acoustic shadowing. The scrotal wall is markedly thickened and edematous with fluid tracking along the fascial planes extending from the perineum to the anterior abdominal wall. Despite the extensive soft tissue changes, both testes demonstrate preserved intratesticular blood flow on color Doppler, excluding testicular torsion. Complex fluid collections are identified in the perineal space. These findings are diagnostic of Fournier gangrene, a life-threatening necrotizing soft tissue infection requiring emergent wide surgical debridement and broad-spectrum antibiotics.
