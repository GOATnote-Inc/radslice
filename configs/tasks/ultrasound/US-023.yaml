reference_solution: |
  Bedside echocardiography demonstrates acute right ventricular dilation with an RV/LV ratio of 1.4 in the apical four-chamber view. McConnell sign is present with free wall hypokinesis and preserved apical contractility. Moderate tricuspid regurgitation is identified with an estimated RVSP of 50 mmHg. The interventricular septum bows toward the left ventricle. Compression ultrasound of the right lower extremity reveals a non-compressible right common femoral vein with echogenic intraluminal thrombus. These combined findings of RV strain pattern and proximal DVT are highly consistent with acute pulmonary embolism.
