reference_solution: |
  Ultrasound of the right lower leg demonstrates a markedly enlarged anterior compartment with tense, convex bowing of the anterior fascial boundary. The compartment musculature appears edematous with heterogeneous echotexture and loss of normal fibrillar architecture. Color Doppler reveals significantly diminished flow in the anterior tibial artery within the compartment. The deep venous system is patent and compressible, excluding DVT. The lateral and posterior compartments appear less affected but should be monitored. In the clinical context of severe pain out of proportion with passive stretch, these findings are consistent with acute anterior compartment syndrome of the right lower leg, requiring emergent fasciotomy.
