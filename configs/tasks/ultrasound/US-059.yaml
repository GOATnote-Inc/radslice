reference_solution: |
  Extremity ultrasound of the right lower leg demonstrates diffuse swelling and increased echogenicity of the anterior and lateral compartment musculature with loss of the normal fibrillar muscle architecture, consistent with muscle edema from crush injury. The anterior compartment is markedly expanded with convex bowing of the anterior fascial boundary. Doppler assessment shows diminished but present arterial flow in the dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial arteries. Bedside echocardiography reveals mild RV dilation concerning for early hyperkalemic effects. These findings in a patient extricated from prolonged entrapment are consistent with crush syndrome and impending compartment syndrome, warranting aggressive resuscitation and monitoring for hyperkalemia and renal failure.
