reference_solution: |
  Duplex ultrasound of the carotid arteries demonstrates a heterogeneous
  echogenic atherosclerotic plaque at the origin of the right internal carotid
  artery causing significant luminal narrowing. The plaque contains both
  calcified and soft tissue components. Peak systolic velocity (PSV) in the
  right ICA measures 340 cm/s with an end-diastolic velocity (EDV) of 120 cm/s,
  and an ICA/CCA PSV ratio of 4.2, consistent with severe stenosis in the
  70-99% range by Society of Radiologists in Ultrasound consensus criteria.
  Color Doppler demonstrates aliasing and turbulent flow at the stenotic
  segment. The right common carotid artery and external carotid artery are
  patent. The left carotid system demonstrates mild intimal thickening without
  hemodynamically significant stenosis. Bilateral vertebral arteries show
  antegrade flow.
  Impression: Severe right internal carotid artery stenosis (70-99%) secondary
  to atherosclerotic plaque. Vascular surgery or interventional consultation
  recommended.
