reference_solution: |
  Transcranial Doppler examination demonstrates markedly elevated pulsatility index of 2.1 in the right middle cerebral artery with diminished end-diastolic flow velocities. The right MCA mean flow velocity is reduced compared to the left (35 cm/s vs 62 cm/s), suggesting ipsilateral increased resistance from mass effect. The waveform morphology shows sharp systolic upstroke with rapid diastolic runoff consistent with elevated intracranial pressure. The contralateral left MCA demonstrates mildly elevated pulsatility. These findings are consistent with a space-occupying intracranial process on the right, correlating with a hemorrhagic stroke causing elevated intracranial pressure.
