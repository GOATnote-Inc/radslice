reference_solution: |
  PA chest radiograph demonstrates findings consistent with chronic obstructive
  pulmonary disease and hyperinflation. The hemidiaphragms are markedly flattened
  bilaterally with more than 10 posterior ribs visible above the diaphragm. The
  lung fields are hyperlucent with attenuation of the peripheral vascular
  markings, consistent with emphysematous changes. The cardiac silhouette appears
  elongated and vertically oriented. The retrosternal clear space is increased.
  No focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax is identified. No
  acute superimposed process. These findings are consistent with moderate to
  severe COPD with hyperinflation. Pulmonary function testing is recommended for
  disease severity quantification.
  Impression: COPD with bilateral hyperinflation and emphysematous changes.
