reference_solution: |
  Radiograph of the right foot demonstrates prominent periarticular soft tissue swelling centered on the first metatarsophalangeal joint. Well-defined juxta-articular erosions with sclerotic margins and characteristic overhanging edges are noted at the first metatarsal head, consistent with chronic tophaceous gout. Joint space is relatively preserved. Soft tissue density nodules are present in the periarticular region, suggestive of tophi. No fracture or dislocation is identified.
