  FINDINGS: PA chest radiograph demonstrates bilateral upper lobe consolidation
  with multiple thick-walled cavities. The cavities range from 1.5 to 3 cm in
  diameter. The surrounding lung parenchyma shows patchy airspace opacities
  consistent with active disease. There is volume loss in both upper lobes with
  upward retraction of the bilateral hila. Subtle nodular opacities are seen in
  the bilateral lower lobes, potentially representing endobronchial spread
  (tree-in-bud pattern, better assessed on CT). No pleural effusion or
  pneumothorax. The cardiac silhouette is normal. The trachea is midline.
  IMPRESSION: Bilateral upper lobe cavitary consolidation, highly suggestive of
  active pulmonary tuberculosis. Airborne isolation precautions should be
  initiated. Sputum for AFB smear and culture (three samples) and nucleic acid
  amplification testing are urgently recommended. CT chest may be obtained for
  further characterization of disease extent. Public health notification required.
