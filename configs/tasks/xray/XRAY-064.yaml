reference_solution: |
  Supine AP chest radiograph obtained in the trauma bay demonstrates multiple radiopaque projectile fragments within both hemithoraces. Bilateral hemopneumothoraces are present with bilateral air-fluid levels. The mediastinum appears widened, raising concern for great vessel or cardiac injury. Bilateral rib fractures are noted. Bilateral chest tubes should be placed emergently. CT angiography of the chest is urgently recommended once the patient is hemodynamically stabilized to evaluate for aortic, cardiac, and tracheobronchial injuries.
