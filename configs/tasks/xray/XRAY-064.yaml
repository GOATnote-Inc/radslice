    - small apical pneumothorax

  key_findings:
    - { finding: "thin linear opacity paralleling the inferior cortex of the clavicle", location: "bilateral supraclavicular regions", required: true }
    - { finding: "lung markings present beyond the linear opacity", location: "bilateral apices", required: true }
    - { finding: "opacity follows the clavicular contour exactly", location: "bilateral clavicles", required: false }
  severity: mild
  laterality: bilateral
  negatives:
    - true pneumothorax
    - visceral pleural line
    - absent lung markings
    - mediastinal shift

reference_solution: |
  PA chest radiograph demonstrates thin linear opacities paralleling the inferior
  cortex of both clavicles, which represent companion shadows. These are caused
  by the soft tissue (skin and subcutaneous fat) overlying the clavicles creating
  a Mach band effect, and should not be confused with visceral pleural lines of
  apical pneumothorax. Key distinguishing features include: lung markings are
  clearly visible beyond the linear opacity, the opacity follows the clavicular
  contour exactly, and there is no sharp visceral pleural line. The lungs are
  clear bilaterally. No true pneumothorax. The cardiac silhouette is normal.
  No other acute abnormality.
  Impression: Companion shadows of the clavicles — normal finding, not apical
  pneumothoraces.
