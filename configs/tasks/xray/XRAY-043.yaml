reference_solution: |
  PA chest radiograph demonstrates a prominent unfolded thoracic aorta with
  tortuosity, which is an age-related degenerative change and should not be
  confused with an aortic aneurysm. Atherosclerotic calcification is seen along
  the aortic wall. The lungs are clear bilaterally without focal consolidation,
  mass, or pleural effusion. No pneumothorax. The cardiac silhouette is within
  normal limits for the patient's age. The costophrenic angles are sharp. The
  mediastinal width is within normal limits when accounting for the aortic
  tortuosity. The visualized osseous structures are intact with mild degenerative
  changes of the thoracic spine.
  Impression: Age-related aortic unfolding and atherosclerosis. No acute
  cardiopulmonary disease.
