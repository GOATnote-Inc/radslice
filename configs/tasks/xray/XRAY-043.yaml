reference_solution: |
  AP and lateral radiographs of the thoracic spine demonstrate collapse of the T8 vertebral body with loss of the left pedicle on the AP view (absent winking owl sign), highly suggestive of a metastatic lytic lesion. There is posterior vertebral body retropulsion on the lateral view. The disc spaces above and below are preserved, arguing against an infectious etiology. These findings indicate pathologic compression fracture with concern for epidural extension and spinal cord compression. Urgent MRI of the entire spine is required.
