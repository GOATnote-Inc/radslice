reference_solution: |
  PA chest radiograph demonstrates what appears to be an elevated left
  hemidiaphragm. However, the diaphragmatic contour peaks laterally rather than
  at its midpoint, which is characteristic of a subpulmonic pleural effusion
  rather than true hemidiaphragm elevation. Additionally, the distance between
  the gastric air bubble and the apparent left hemidiaphragm is increased,
  suggesting interposed fluid. A left lateral decubitus view would demonstrate
  layering of the fluid along the dependent chest wall, confirming a pleural
  effusion. The right lung is clear. No pneumothorax. The cardiac silhouette is
  normal. This diagnosis is important as it changes management from observation
  (for simple diaphragm elevation) to evaluation for effusion etiology.
  Impression: Left subpulmonic pleural effusion — not true hemidiaphragm
  elevation. Decubitus view or ultrasound recommended for confirmation.
