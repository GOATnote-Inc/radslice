reference_solution: |
  Frontal chest radiograph demonstrates pneumomediastinum with air outlining the mediastinal structures. Subcutaneous emphysema is present in the neck. A left pleural effusion is noted. No free subdiaphragmatic air is identified. In the clinical context of caustic substance ingestion, these findings indicate esophageal perforation with chemical mediastinitis. Emergent surgical consultation and water-soluble contrast esophagram (if the patient can swallow) are indicated. CT of the chest and abdomen with oral contrast should be considered for further characterization.
