reference_solution: |
  Abdominal radiograph demonstrates multiple dilated loops of small bowel centrally, measuring up to 4.5 cm in diameter, with prominent valvulae conniventes. The upright view shows multiple air-fluid levels at different heights, consistent with a step-ladder pattern. There is a paucity of gas in the distal colon and rectum. No free intraperitoneal air or pneumatosis is identified. These findings are consistent with a small bowel obstruction, and CT is recommended to identify the transition point and etiology.
