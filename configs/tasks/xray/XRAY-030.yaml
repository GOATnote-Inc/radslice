reference_solution: |
  PA chest radiograph demonstrates air-filled visceral structures, including loops
  of bowel and possibly stomach, within the left hemithorax. The left
  hemidiaphragm contour is absent or markedly disrupted. There is mass effect with
  displacement of the cardiac silhouette and mediastinal structures to the right.
  The left lung is partially compressed by the herniated abdominal contents. The
  right lung is clear and expanded. These findings are consistent with a left-sided
  diaphragmatic hernia, most likely congenital (Bochdalek type) given the
  posterolateral location. CT of the chest and abdomen is recommended for surgical
  planning. In the acute setting, consideration should be given to
  decompression and surgical repair.
  Impression: Left diaphragmatic hernia with bowel herniation into the thorax.
