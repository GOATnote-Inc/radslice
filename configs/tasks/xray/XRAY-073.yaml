  FINDINGS: PA chest radiograph demonstrates bilateral airspace consolidation
  involving the right lower lobe, right middle lobe, and left lower lobe. Air
  bronchograms are visible within the areas of consolidation, confirming
  airspace disease. The right upper lobe and left upper lobe are relatively
  spared. No significant pleural effusion. No pneumothorax. The cardiac
  silhouette is normal in size without cardiomegaly, and there is no
  cephalization of the pulmonary vasculature to suggest cardiogenic edema. No
  cavitation is identified within the consolidation. The mediastinum is midline.
  IMPRESSION: Bilateral multilobar consolidation involving the right lower lobe,
  right middle lobe, and left lower lobe — most consistent with community-
  acquired pneumonia. Given the bilateral multilobar involvement, clinical
  severity assessment and consideration for inpatient management are recommended.
  Correlation with inflammatory markers, blood cultures, and sputum studies advised.
