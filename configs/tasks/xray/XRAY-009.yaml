reference_solution: |
  Frontal chest radiograph demonstrates bilateral perihilar alveolar opacities in a bat-wing distribution consistent with acute pulmonary edema. The cardiac silhouette is normal to mildly enlarged, which in the setting of acute pulmonary edema suggests an acute cardiac event such as ST-elevation myocardial infarction rather than chronic heart failure. No pleural effusions or pneumothorax are identified. Urgent electrocardiographic and cardiac biomarker correlation is recommended.
