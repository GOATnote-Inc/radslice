reference_solution: |
  Abdominal radiograph (KUB) demonstrates a 7 mm radiopaque calcification projected over the expected course of the right ureter at the level of L4, consistent with a ureteral calculus. No comet-tail lucency is identified to suggest a phlebolith. An additional small calcification is noted at the right renal shadow. No bowel dilatation or free air is identified. Non-contrast CT is the gold standard for further evaluation and confirmation of the ureteral stone location.
