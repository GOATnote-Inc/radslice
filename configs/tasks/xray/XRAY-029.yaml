reference_solution: |
  Abdominal radiograph demonstrates radiopaque calcifications in the right upper quadrant consistent with gallstones. A focal sentinel loop of dilated small bowel is noted in the right upper quadrant, suggesting localized inflammatory ileus. No free intraperitoneal air or pneumobilia is identified. While abdominal X-ray has low sensitivity for acute cholecystitis, the findings of gallstones with localized ileus support the clinical diagnosis. Ultrasound is the study of choice for definitive evaluation.
