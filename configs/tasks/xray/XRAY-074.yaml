  FINDINGS: PA chest radiograph demonstrates multiple well-defined round
  opacities of varying sizes (ranging from approximately 1 to 5 cm) scattered
  throughout both lung fields. The nodules are bilateral with a predominantly
  peripheral distribution. No cavitation is identified within the nodules. No
  calcification is present. No associated pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The
  cardiac silhouette is normal in size. The mediastinal contours are within
  normal limits. The visualized osseous structures are intact without lytic
  lesions.
  IMPRESSION: Multiple bilateral pulmonary nodules in a pattern highly consistent
  with pulmonary metastatic disease (cannonball metastases). If no known primary
  malignancy, CT-guided biopsy of a peripheral nodule is recommended for tissue
  diagnosis. CT chest, abdomen, and pelvis with contrast is recommended for
  staging and identification of the primary tumor. PET-CT may be considered.
