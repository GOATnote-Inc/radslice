reference_solution: |
  Towne and lateral mastoid views demonstrate opacification of the right mastoid air cells with loss of the normal trabecular pattern compared to the well-aerated left mastoid. The right middle ear cavity also shows opacification. No erosion of the mastoid cortex is identified to suggest coalescent mastoiditis. These findings are consistent with acute otitis media with associated mastoid effusion. While mastoid radiographs have been largely replaced by CT for complicated cases, these findings in an uncomplicated clinical presentation support the diagnosis of acute otitis media.
