reference_solution: |
  Yes, there are rib fractures visible on this chest radiograph. Fracture lines
  are identified involving the right 8th and 9th posterior ribs with cortical
  disruption and minimal displacement. No flail segment is present as these are
  single fracture sites. There is no associated pneumothorax or pleural effusion
  to suggest hemothorax. The lungs are otherwise clear. No pulmonary contusion
  adjacent to the fracture sites. Clinical management should focus on adequate
  pain control and incentive spirometry to prevent atelectasis and pneumonia.
