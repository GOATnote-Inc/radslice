reference_solution: |
  PA chest radiograph demonstrates bilateral cervical ribs arising from the C7
  transverse processes, which is an anatomic variant present in approximately
  0.5-1% of the population. The lungs are clear bilaterally without focal
  consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax. The cardiac silhouette is
  normal in size. The mediastinal contours are unremarkable. The costophrenic
  angles are sharp. The remaining visualized osseous structures are intact.
  Cervical ribs are usually asymptomatic but may be associated with thoracic
  outlet syndrome if clinically relevant symptoms are present.
  Impression: Bilateral cervical ribs — anatomic variant. No acute cardiopulmonary
  disease.
