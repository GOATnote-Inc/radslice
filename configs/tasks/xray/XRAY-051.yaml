reference_solution: |
  Abdominal radiograph of a premature neonate demonstrates multiple dilated loops of bowel with pneumatosis intestinalis, seen as linear and bubbly lucencies within the bowel wall, most prominent in the right lower quadrant. Branching linear lucencies are present over the liver consistent with portal venous gas. No pneumoperitoneum is identified. These findings are consistent with necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), classified as modified Bell stage IIB. Serial radiographs and surgical consultation are recommended.
