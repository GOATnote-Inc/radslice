reference_solution: |
  Portable AP chest radiograph demonstrates a right-sided chest tube with the tip
  and side hole projecting over the right hemithorax in satisfactory position.
  Despite the chest tube, there is a residual right apical pneumothorax with a
  visible visceral pleural line at the right apex. The pneumothorax appears
  smaller than expected if there was a prior large pneumothorax, suggesting
  partial re-expansion. The right lung is partially re-expanded. The left lung is
  clear. No mediastinal shift or tension physiology. No pleural effusion or
  hemothorax. Recommend confirming adequate chest tube function (suction, water
  seal patency, output) and serial follow-up radiograph to assess for further
  re-expansion.
  Impression: Right chest tube in satisfactory position with residual apical
  pneumothorax — monitor for resolution.
