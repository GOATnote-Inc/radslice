reference_solution: |
  AP pelvis radiograph demonstrates a displaced fracture through the left femoral neck (Garden type III) with disruption of Shenton line. The left lower extremity is shortened and externally rotated. The trabecular pattern of the femoral neck is disrupted. No lytic lesions are identified to suggest pathologic fracture. The right hip is unremarkable. Orthopedic consultation for surgical management is recommended.
