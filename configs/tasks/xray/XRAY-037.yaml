reference_solution: |
  PA chest radiograph demonstrates bilateral apical fibrocavitary changes with
  volume loss in both upper lobes. There is upward retraction of the bilateral
  hila, indicating chronic upper lobe volume loss. Calcified granulomas are seen
  scattered in the bilateral apices. The fibrotic changes include linear
  opacities and architectural distortion. The lower lobes demonstrate
  compensatory hyperinflation. No active consolidation or air-fluid levels to
  suggest reactivation. The cardiac silhouette is normal. No pleural effusion.
  These findings are consistent with sequelae of prior granulomatous disease,
  most likely tuberculosis. If clinical symptoms (cough, fever, weight loss)
  are present, sputum for AFB should be obtained to exclude reactivation.
  Impression: Bilateral apical fibrotic changes — sequelae of prior TB. Exclude
  reactivation if clinically indicated.
