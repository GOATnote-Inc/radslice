reference_solution: |
  AP soft tissue neck radiograph demonstrates symmetric subglottic narrowing of the trachea producing the classic steeple sign. The lateral view shows a normal epiglottis and normal prevertebral soft tissues. No irregular mucosal thickening is identified to suggest bacterial tracheitis. These findings, in the clinical context of a young child with barking cough and stridor, are consistent with croup (viral laryngotracheobronchitis).
