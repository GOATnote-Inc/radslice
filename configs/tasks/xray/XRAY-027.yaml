reference_solution: |
  Frontal chest radiograph demonstrates extensive pneumomediastinum and bilateral subcutaneous emphysema. A right-sided pneumothorax persists despite chest tube placement, with the collapsed lung falling to a dependent position (fallen lung sign), which is pathognomonic for tracheobronchial disruption. The continuous diaphragm sign is present. These findings are consistent with a tracheobronchial injury, and urgent bronchoscopy is indicated for localization and surgical planning.
