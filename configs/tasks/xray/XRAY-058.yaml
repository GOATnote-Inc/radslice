reference_solution: |
  PA chest radiograph demonstrates a rounded opacity in the right lower zone
  abutting the posterior pleural surface, which could be mistaken for a primary
  lung mass. However, the characteristic comet tail sign is present, with
  pulmonary vessels and bronchi curving toward the opacity, which is pathognomonic
  for round atelectasis (Blesovsky syndrome). Adjacent pleural thickening is
  noted along the right posterior chest wall, often seen in association with
  asbestos exposure. The opacity represents folded, atelectatic lung tissue
  rather than a true neoplasm. The left lung is clear. No pleural effusion. CT
  with contrast is recommended to confirm the diagnosis and demonstrate the
  classic comet tail of vessels on axial imaging.
  Impression: Round atelectasis — not a primary lung mass. CT confirmation
  recommended.
