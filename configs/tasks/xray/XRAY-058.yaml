reference_solution: |
  Frontal chest radiograph demonstrates bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left, with blunting of both costophrenic angles. There is mild bilateral interstitial edema consistent with capillary leak. The cardiac silhouette appears mildly enlarged, possibly reflecting pericardial effusion. No focal consolidation or pneumothorax is identified. In the clinical context of thrombocytopenia and hemoconcentration, these findings of bilateral effusions from capillary leak are characteristic of dengue hemorrhagic fever. Serial monitoring and fluid management are essential.
