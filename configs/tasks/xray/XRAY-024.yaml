reference_solution: |
  Frontal chest radiograph demonstrates a dense lobar consolidation in the right lower lobe with well-defined air bronchograms. A small right-sided parapneumonic pleural effusion is present with blunting of the costophrenic angle. The remainder of the lung fields are clear. No pneumothorax or cavitation is identified. These findings are consistent with community-acquired pneumonia.
