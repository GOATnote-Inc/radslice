reference_solution: |
  Frontal chest radiograph demonstrates bilateral lower lobe consolidation with air bronchograms, consistent with acute chest syndrome in the clinical context of sickle cell disease. Cardiomegaly is present, likely reflecting chronic anemia with high-output cardiac state. A small left pleural effusion is noted. The thoracic vertebral bodies demonstrate characteristic H-shaped endplate depressions (Lincoln log vertebrae) from prior infarctions. These findings in a sickle cell patient suggest acute chest syndrome requiring aggressive treatment including exchange transfusion consideration.
