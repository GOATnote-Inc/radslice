reference_solution: |
  PA chest radiograph demonstrates a left pectoral implantable cardioverter-
  defibrillator (AICD) with leads coursing through the left subclavian vein into
  the right heart. The shock coil and defibrillator lead tip are in the right
  ventricle in satisfactory position. No lead fracture, kinking, or
  dislodgement. The lungs are clear bilaterally without focal consolidation,
  pleural effusion, or pneumothorax. The cardiac silhouette is within normal
  limits. The costophrenic angles are sharp. No other acute abnormality.
  Impression: AICD with leads in satisfactory position. No acute cardiopulmonary
  abnormality.
