reference_solution: |
  Abdominal radiograph demonstrates a calcified appendicolith in the right lower quadrant. A sentinel loop of focally dilated ileum is noted in the right lower quadrant, consistent with localized ileus. The right psoas shadow is indistinct. No free intraperitoneal air is identified. While the abdominal X-ray has limited sensitivity for appendicitis, the combination of an appendicolith and localized ileus is suggestive. CT or ultrasound is recommended for definitive evaluation.
