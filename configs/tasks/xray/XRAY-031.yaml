reference_solution: |
  Frontal chest radiograph demonstrates a radiopaque disc-shaped foreign body at the level of the thoracic inlet, oriented in the coronal plane (appearing en face on the AP view). This orientation is characteristic of an esophageal foreign body, as tracheal foreign bodies typically orient in the sagittal plane. No pneumomediastinum or prevertebral soft tissue swelling is identified to suggest perforation. Lateral view confirms the posterior (esophageal) location. Endoscopic retrieval is recommended, particularly if a button battery is suspected.
