reference_solution: |
  PA chest radiograph demonstrates tram-track opacities in the right lower lobe,
  representing dilated, thick-walled bronchi seen in longitudinal section. Several
  ring shadows are also present in the right lower zone, representing dilated
  bronchi seen en face. There is subtle volume loss in the right lower lobe with
  crowding of the pulmonary vasculature. Peribronchial thickening is noted. The
  left lung is clear. No pleural effusion, pneumothorax, or consolidation. The
  cardiac silhouette is normal. These findings are consistent with bronchiectasis
  in the right lower lobe. HRCT is recommended for definitive characterization
  and to assess the full extent of disease. Clinical correlation for underlying
  etiology (post-infectious, cystic fibrosis, immune deficiency) is advised.
  Impression: Right lower lobe bronchiectasis.
