reference_solution: |
  Frontal chest radiograph demonstrates a visible visceral pleural line along the right hemithorax with absence of lung markings peripheral to this line, consistent with a right-sided pneumothorax. The pneumothorax is moderate in size. There is no mediastinal shift to suggest tension physiology. The left lung is clear. No pleural effusion is identified. Clinical correlation regarding symptoms and need for chest tube placement versus observation is recommended.
