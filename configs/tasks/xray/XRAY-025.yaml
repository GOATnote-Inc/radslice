reference_solution: |
  PA chest radiograph demonstrates bilateral peripheral reticular opacities
  predominantly in the lower lung zones with a pattern of honeycombing, consistent
  with pulmonary fibrosis in a usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP) distribution.
  The lung volumes appear reduced. There is suggestion of traction bronchiectasis
  in the lower lobes bilaterally. The upper lung zones are relatively spared. No
  pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The cardiac silhouette is normal in size. No
  hilar or mediastinal lymphadenopathy. High-resolution CT of the chest is
  recommended for definitive characterization. In the appropriate clinical context,
  these findings are consistent with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF).
  Impression: Bilateral basal peripheral fibrosis with honeycombing — UIP pattern,
  consistent with IPF. HRCT recommended.
