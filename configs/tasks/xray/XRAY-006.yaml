reference_solution: |
  Frontal chest radiograph demonstrates a markedly enlarged, globular cardiac silhouette with the classic water-bottle configuration. Notably, the lung fields are clear without pulmonary edema, which is a characteristic finding of pericardial effusion rather than intrinsic cardiac failure. The normal hilar vascular markings are obscured by the enlarged pericardial shadow. These findings are highly suggestive of a large pericardial effusion; urgent echocardiography is required to assess for tamponade physiology.
