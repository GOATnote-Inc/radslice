reference_solution: |
  Frontal chest radiograph obtained following blast exposure demonstrates bilateral perihilar alveolar opacities in a butterfly pattern, consistent with primary blast lung injury. A right-sided pneumothorax is present. Pneumomediastinum is identified with air tracking along the mediastinal structures. Multiple small radiopaque foreign body fragments (shrapnel) are scattered across both hemithoraces and the soft tissues. These findings reflect the combined effects of primary blast injury (barotrauma) and secondary blast injury (fragment penetration). Emergent stabilization including chest tube placement and serial imaging are warranted.
