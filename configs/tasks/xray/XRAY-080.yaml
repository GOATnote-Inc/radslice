reference_solution: |
  PA chest radiograph demonstrates a lobulated mass at the left hilum with
  associated opacification of the left lower lobe, consistent with post-
  obstructive atelectasis/consolidation. The S sign of Golden may be present, with
  the proximal convex margin of the mass transitioning to the concave margin of
  the collapsed lobe, which is pathognomonic for a central obstructing lesion.
  There is volume loss on the left side with subtle leftward mediastinal shift.
  The right lung is clear. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The cardiac
  silhouette is partially obscured. These findings are highly concerning for a
  central bronchogenic carcinoma causing left lower lobe bronchus obstruction.
  Contrast-enhanced CT chest is urgently recommended for staging, followed by
  bronchoscopy with biopsy for tissue diagnosis. PET-CT should be considered
  for complete staging.
  Impression: Left hilar mass with post-obstructive left lower lobe collapse —
  strongly suspicious for bronchogenic carcinoma. Urgent CT and bronchoscopy
  recommended.
