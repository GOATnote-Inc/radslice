reference_solution: |
  Radiograph of the face (modified Waters view) demonstrates a small radiopaque foreign body projected within the right orbit, consistent with an intraocular foreign body. Periorbital soft tissue swelling is noted. No orbital fracture is identified on this view. In the clinical context of penetrating eye injury, these findings raise concern for globe rupture. CT of the orbits is recommended for precise localization. Emergent ophthalmologic consultation is required, and MRI is contraindicated if a metallic foreign body is suspected.
