reference_solution: |
  Frontal chest radiograph demonstrates a focal area of consolidation in the right upper lobe with an associated nodular opacity. No significant pleural effusion is identified, which may reflect the impaired inflammatory response in a neutropenic patient. A left subclavian tunneled central venous catheter is in satisfactory position. In the setting of febrile neutropenia, the differential includes bacterial infection, invasive fungal disease (aspergillosis), and viral pneumonitis. CT of the chest is recommended for further characterization, as X-ray may underestimate the extent of disease in immunocompromised patients.
