reference_solution: |
  The cardiac silhouette is enlarged. The cardiothoracic ratio (CTR) exceeds 0.5
  on this PA chest radiograph, consistent with cardiomegaly. The heart is
  predominantly enlarged to the left, suggesting left-sided chamber enlargement.
  There is no definite pulmonary vascular congestion to suggest acute heart
  failure at this time, though clinical correlation with symptoms and
  echocardiography is recommended to determine the etiology of cardiomegaly
  (valvular disease, dilated cardiomyopathy, hypertensive heart disease, etc.).
  The lungs are otherwise clear. No pleural effusion.
