reference_solution: |
  Radiograph of the right forearm and hand demonstrates periosteal new bone formation along the radius and ulna with soft tissue swelling. Focal soft tissue calcification is noted at the wrist, consistent with the entry point of electrical current. No acute fracture is identified. In the setting of electrical injury, these findings represent periosteal reaction from the thermal effects of current passage through bone. Follow-up imaging is recommended to assess for progressive heterotopic ossification and potential growth plate injury in pediatric patients.
