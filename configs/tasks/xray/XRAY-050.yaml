reference_solution: |
  Abdominal radiograph of a child demonstrates a soft tissue density mass in the right upper quadrant with a crescent of gas outlining it (crescent sign), consistent with the intussusceptum. There is paucity of gas in the right lower quadrant (cecum not gas-filled). Mild proximal small bowel dilatation is noted. No free intraperitoneal air or pneumatosis is identified. These findings are consistent with ileocolic intussusception. Ultrasound confirmation and air or hydrostatic enema reduction should be performed urgently.
