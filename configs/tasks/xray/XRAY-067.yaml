reference_solution: |
  AP pelvis radiograph demonstrates extensive subcutaneous gas within the perineal and scrotal soft tissues, tracking along the fascial planes into the bilateral inguinal regions and proximal thighs. Marked soft tissue swelling is noted in the perineal region. The pelvic bones are intact. No free intraperitoneal air is identified. These findings are characteristic of Fournier's gangrene (perineal necrotizing fasciitis), which is a surgical emergency requiring immediate wide debridement and broad-spectrum antibiotics.
