reference_solution: |
  PA chest radiograph demonstrates a small, densely calcified nodule in the right
  lower lobe measuring approximately 8 mm. The calcification pattern is central
  and complete, which is a characteristically benign pattern consistent with a
  granuloma, most commonly from prior histoplasmosis or tuberculosis exposure. No
  soft tissue component is seen surrounding the calcification. No additional
  nodules or lymphadenopathy. The remaining lung fields are clear. No pleural
  effusion or pneumothorax. The cardiac silhouette is normal. Benign calcified
  granulomas are common incidental findings and do not require follow-up or
  further workup. The complete central calcification pattern distinguishes this
  from potentially malignant nodules.
  Impression: Calcified granuloma in the right lower lobe — benign finding, no
  follow-up required.
