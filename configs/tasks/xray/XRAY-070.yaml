reference_solution: |
  Frontal chest radiograph demonstrates bilateral ground-glass opacities with early perihilar pulmonary edema. The cardiac silhouette is normal in size. No focal consolidation or pneumothorax is identified. The chest X-ray in carbon monoxide poisoning is often normal or may show non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema in severe cases due to myocardial depression and capillary leak. A normal CXR does not exclude significant CO exposure. Carboxyhemoglobin level and hyperbaric oxygen therapy consideration are the clinical priorities.
