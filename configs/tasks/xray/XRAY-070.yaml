reference_solution: |
  Yes, the endotracheal tube (ETT) is appropriately positioned. The tip of the
  ETT projects approximately 4 cm above the carina, within the ideal range of
  3-5 cm in the mid-trachea. The tube is in the trachea and not in the esophagus,
  as confirmed by its midline position and the absence of gastric distension.
  The ETT does not extend into either mainstem bronchus. The cuff appears
  appropriately inflated without overdistension. The lungs are symmetrically
  aerated. No pneumothorax related to intubation. No other acute abnormality.
