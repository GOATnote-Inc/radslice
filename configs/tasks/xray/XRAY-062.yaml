reference_solution: |
  Frontal chest radiograph demonstrates bilateral diffuse alveolar opacities affecting all lung zones, consistent with ARDS. The cardiac silhouette is normal in size, supporting a non-cardiogenic etiology. A right internal jugular central venous catheter is present with tip at the cavoatrial junction. An endotracheal tube is in satisfactory position. No pneumothorax or large pleural effusion is identified. In the clinical context of sepsis, these bilateral opacities meet the Berlin criteria imaging component for ARDS.
