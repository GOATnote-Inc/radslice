reference_solution: |
  Frontal chest radiograph of a premature neonate demonstrates bilateral diffuse granular (ground-glass) opacities with air bronchograms extending to the periphery, consistent with surfactant deficiency. Lung volumes are low. An endotracheal tube is in satisfactory position with tip at the level of T1-T2. An umbilical venous catheter projects over the right atrium, and an umbilical arterial catheter tip is at T8. No pneumothorax is identified. These findings are classic for neonatal respiratory distress syndrome (hyaline membrane disease).
