reference_solution: |
  Frontal chest radiograph demonstrates bilateral pulmonary edema with perihilar alveolar opacities and interstitial thickening. The cardiac silhouette is normal in size, which in combination with acute pulmonary edema suggests a sudden cardiac insult rather than chronic heart failure. Notably absent is aortic or coronary calcification, consistent with the typically younger patient demographic of SCAD. No mediastinal widening or pneumothorax is identified. Chest X-ray findings in SCAD are nonspecific; definitive diagnosis requires coronary angiography. The normal heart size with acute pulmonary edema in a young patient should raise clinical suspicion.
