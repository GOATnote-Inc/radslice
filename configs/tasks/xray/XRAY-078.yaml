reference_solution: |
  Upright PA chest radiograph demonstrates a right-sided hydropneumothorax with a
  clearly visible air-fluid level in the right pleural space. Above the fluid
  level, there is a pneumothorax with absent lung markings. Below the fluid level,
  there is homogeneous opacification from the pleural fluid collection. The
  air-fluid interface is sharp and horizontal, confirming the simultaneous presence
  of air and fluid in the pleural space. The right lung is partially collapsed.
  The mediastinum is mildly shifted to the left. The left lung is clear. The
  combination of air and fluid in the pleural space raises concern for
  bronchopleural fistula, esophageal perforation, or traumatic etiology. Chest
  tube placement and CT chest are recommended.
  Impression: Right hydropneumothorax — chest tube and further evaluation
  recommended.
