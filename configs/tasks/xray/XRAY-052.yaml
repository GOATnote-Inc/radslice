reference_solution: |
  PA chest radiograph demonstrates a curvilinear line in the medial aspect of the
  right upper lobe representing an azygos fissure, with a teardrop-shaped opacity
  at its inferior extent corresponding to the azygos vein. This is a normal
  anatomic variant caused by failure of the azygos vein to migrate to its normal
  position during embryologic development, resulting in an accessory fissure
  containing two layers each of visceral and parietal pleura. The lungs are clear
  bilaterally without focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax.
  The cardiac silhouette is normal. This finding should not be confused with a
  right paratracheal mass or pneumothorax.
  Impression: Azygos fissure — normal anatomic variant. No acute cardiopulmonary
  disease.
