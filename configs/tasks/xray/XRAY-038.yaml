reference_solution: |
  Weight-bearing AP radiograph of the right knee demonstrates moderate medial compartment joint space narrowing with marginal osteophyte formation at the femoral condyles and tibial plateau. Subchondral sclerosis of the medial tibial plateau is present. Small subchondral cysts are noted medially. The lateral compartment and patellofemoral joint are relatively preserved. No acute fracture is identified. These findings are consistent with moderate osteoarthritis, predominantly affecting the medial compartment.
