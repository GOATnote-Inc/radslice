reference_solution: |
  PA chest radiograph demonstrates bilateral calcified pleural plaques along the
  lateral chest walls and on the hemidiaphragms bilaterally, seen both en face
  and in profile. The plaques have a characteristic holly-leaf morphology. There
  is no associated pleural effusion or pleural mass to suggest mesothelioma. The
  lung parenchyma appears clear without interstitial fibrosis or asbestosis. The
  cardiac silhouette is normal. No pneumothorax. These calcified pleural plaques
  are pathognomonic for prior asbestos exposure. While plaques themselves are
  benign, they serve as a marker for asbestos exposure and should prompt
  surveillance for mesothelioma and asbestos-related lung disease. Low-dose
  CT screening may be considered depending on clinical risk factors.
  Impression: Bilateral calcified pleural plaques — asbestos exposure marker.
