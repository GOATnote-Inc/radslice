reference_solution: |
  Frontal chest radiograph demonstrates cardiomegaly with a cardiothoracic ratio exceeding 0.5. There is bilateral pulmonary vascular congestion with cephalization of the pulmonary vasculature and bilateral interstitial edema. Small bilateral pleural effusions are noted with blunting of the costophrenic angles. These findings are consistent with acute decompensated heart failure.
