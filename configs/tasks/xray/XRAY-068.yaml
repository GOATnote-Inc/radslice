reference_solution: |
  Frontal chest radiograph demonstrates patchy bilateral alveolar opacities, asymmetric and more prominent on the right. The cardiac silhouette is normal in size, indicating a non-cardiogenic etiology. The pulmonary arteries appear prominent, suggesting elevated pulmonary artery pressure. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified. In the clinical context of recent rapid ascent to high altitude, these findings are consistent with high-altitude pulmonary edema (HAPE). Immediate descent and supplemental oxygen are the primary treatments.
