reference_solution: |
  Frontal chest radiograph demonstrates pneumomediastinum with air outlining the mediastinal structures including the V-sign of Naclerio along the left hemidiaphragm. A moderate left pleural effusion is present. Subcutaneous emphysema extends into the neck. No free subdiaphragmatic air is identified. In the clinical setting of forceful vomiting, these findings are consistent with esophageal perforation (Boerhaave syndrome). Urgent contrast esophagram and surgical consultation are indicated.
