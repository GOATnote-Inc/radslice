reference_solution: |
  Frontal chest radiograph demonstrates complete collapse of the left lung with a large left pneumothorax. There is marked mediastinal shift to the right with tracheal deviation. The left hemidiaphragm is depressed and flattened. Widened intercostal spaces are noted on the left. These findings are diagnostic of a tension pneumothorax, which is a clinical emergency requiring immediate needle decompression followed by chest tube insertion.
