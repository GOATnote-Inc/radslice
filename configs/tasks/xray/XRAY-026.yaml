reference_solution: |
  PA chest radiograph demonstrates a large lobulated mass in the right apical
  region measuring approximately 6 cm. There is associated cortical destruction of
  the right 2nd and 3rd posterior ribs, indicating direct chest wall invasion. The
  mass has irregular margins and appears to extend into the soft tissues of the
  chest wall. No cavitation is identified within the mass. The remaining lung
  fields are clear. No pleural effusion or contralateral abnormality. The cardiac
  silhouette is normal. These findings are highly concerning for a primary
  bronchogenic carcinoma, potentially a Pancoast (superior sulcus) tumor given the
  apical location and rib destruction. Contrast-enhanced CT of the chest with
  biopsy and staging workup including PET-CT are urgently recommended.
  Impression: Right apical lung mass with rib destruction — biopsy and staging
  recommended.
