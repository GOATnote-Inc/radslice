reference_solution: |
  AP radiograph of the right shoulder demonstrates anterior and inferior displacement of the humeral head relative to the glenoid fossa, consistent with an anterior glenohumeral dislocation. The humeral head is positioned subcoracoid. A subtle Hill-Sachs impaction deformity is noted along the posterolateral humeral head. No associated greater tuberosity fracture is identified. Post-reduction films are recommended to confirm joint congruence and exclude fracture.
