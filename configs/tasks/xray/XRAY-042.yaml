reference_solution: |
  Portable AP chest radiograph demonstrates appropriately positioned support
  devices. The endotracheal tube tip is located approximately 4 cm above the
  carina in satisfactory position. A right internal jugular central venous
  catheter has its tip at the cavoatrial junction, in appropriate position. A
  nasogastric tube courses into the stomach with the tip below the diaphragm.
  The lungs are clear bilaterally without focal consolidation, pleural effusion,
  or pneumothorax. No interval development of complication related to line
  placement. The cardiac silhouette is normal in size for AP projection.
  Impression: Appropriately positioned ETT, central venous catheter, and NG tube.
  No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.
