reference_solution: |
  Frontal chest radiograph in a peripartum patient demonstrates diffuse bilateral pulmonary edema with confluent alveolar opacities. The cardiac silhouette is normal in size, suggesting a non-cardiogenic etiology. The pulmonary arteries may appear prominent. No focal consolidation or pneumothorax is identified. In the clinical context of acute cardiorespiratory collapse during labor or delivery, these findings are consistent with amniotic fluid embolism. This is a clinical diagnosis supported by imaging findings of non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema.
