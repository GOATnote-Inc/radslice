reference_solution: |
  PA chest radiograph demonstrates a significantly widened superior mediastinum
  measuring greater than 8 cm at the level of the aortic arch. There is loss of
  the normal sharp aortic knob contour. The trachea is deviated slightly to the
  right. A left apical pleural cap is noted, raising concern for mediastinal
  hemorrhage tracking into the pleural apex. The left mainstem bronchus appears
  depressed. The lung parenchyma is otherwise clear. No pneumothorax or rib
  fractures. In the appropriate clinical context (acute chest pain, trauma, or
  hypertension), these findings are concerning for acute aortic pathology
  including dissection or traumatic aortic injury. Emergent CT angiography of the
  chest is strongly recommended.
  Impression: Widened mediastinum with loss of aortic knob contour — emergent CTA
  recommended to exclude aortic dissection or traumatic aortic injury.
