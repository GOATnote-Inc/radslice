reference_solution: |
  Radiograph of the left lower extremity demonstrates vascular calcification along the arterial distribution. No fracture is identified. There is no subcutaneous emphysema or soft tissue gas to suggest gas gangrene. Soft tissue swelling is noted. While X-ray findings in acute limb ischemia are often nonspecific, the vascular calcification suggests underlying peripheral arterial disease; clinical correlation with pulse examination and urgent vascular imaging is recommended.
