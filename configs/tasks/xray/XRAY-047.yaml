reference_solution: |
  Lateral soft tissue neck radiograph demonstrates marked widening of the prevertebral soft tissues measuring 15 mm at C2 and 22 mm at C6, significantly exceeding normal limits. The pharyngeal airway is displaced anteriorly. No gas is identified within the soft tissues. The epiglottis appears normal. Loss of the normal cervical lordosis is noted, likely secondary to muscle spasm. These findings are consistent with a retropharyngeal abscess. CT with contrast is recommended for further characterization and surgical planning.
