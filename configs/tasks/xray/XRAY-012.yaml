reference_solution: |
  Frontal chest radiograph demonstrates extensive linear gas lucencies tracking through
  the soft tissues of the bilateral chest wall, consistent with subcutaneous emphysema.
  Air is seen dissecting along fascial planes of the lateral chest wall and extending
  toward the base of the neck. The pectoralis muscles are outlined by gas bilaterally.
  No definite large pneumothorax identified, though a small component cannot be excluded
  given the extent of subcutaneous air. Lungs are otherwise clear. Clinical correlation
  is recommended to determine etiology (trauma, recent procedure, or spontaneous).
