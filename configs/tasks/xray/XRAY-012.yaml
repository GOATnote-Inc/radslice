reference_solution: |
  Frontal chest radiograph obtained in a trauma setting demonstrates marked widening of the superior mediastinum exceeding 8 cm with loss of the normal aortic knob contour. A left apical pleural cap is present. The trachea and nasogastric tube are deviated to the right. Depression of the left mainstem bronchus is noted. A moderate left hemothorax is also present. These findings are highly suspicious for traumatic aortic injury at the aortic isthmus, and emergent CT angiography of the chest is indicated.
