reference_solution: |
  Frontal chest radiograph demonstrates bilateral pulmonary edema with perihilar haziness and interstitial thickening. Mild cardiomegaly is present, consistent with myocardial depression from hypothermia. Dependent consolidation is noted in the bilateral lower lobes, which may represent concurrent aspiration. No pneumothorax is identified. In the clinical context of accidental hypothermia, these findings reflect both cardiogenic and non-cardiogenic mechanisms of pulmonary edema. Rewarming and supportive care are indicated.
