reference_solution: |
  PA chest radiograph demonstrates innumerable tiny (1-3 mm) nodular opacities
  diffusely distributed throughout both lung fields in a classic miliary pattern.
  The nodules are uniform in size and randomly distributed without zonal
  predominance. There is subtle bilateral hilar prominence that may represent
  lymphadenopathy. No focal consolidation, cavitary lesion, or pleural effusion
  is identified. The cardiac silhouette is normal in size. In the appropriate
  clinical context of fever, weight loss, and immunocompromise, these findings
  are highly suspicious for miliary tuberculosis. Sputum AFB cultures, CT chest,
  and consideration of bronchoscopy with BAL are recommended.
  Impression: Miliary pattern — highly suspicious for miliary tuberculosis.
