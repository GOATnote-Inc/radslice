reference_solution: |
  Frontal chest radiograph demonstrates asymmetric hyperinflation of the right lung with mediastinal shift to the left, consistent with a ball-valve obstructing mechanism. No radiopaque foreign body is identified, though most aspirated foreign bodies in children are radiolucent. Inspiratory and expiratory views or decubitus films may help confirm air trapping. Bronchoscopy should be considered for definitive diagnosis and retrieval.
