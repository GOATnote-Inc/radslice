reference_solution: |
  Frontal chest radiograph demonstrates focal alveolar opacities in the right lung field with possible air bronchograms, consistent with intrapulmonary hemorrhage in the clinical setting of massive hemoptysis. A cavitary lesion is noted in the right upper lobe, which may represent the bleeding source. No pneumothorax or pleural effusion is identified. CT angiography and bronchoscopy are recommended for localization of the bleeding source and potential embolization.
