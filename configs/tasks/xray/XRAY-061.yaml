reference_solution: |
  Lateral thoracic spine radiograph demonstrates compression fractures of multiple thoracic vertebral bodies, likely sustained during severe opisthotonus (sustained muscle spasms). The vertebral endplates are disrupted without lytic lesions, consistent with traumatic rather than pathologic fracture. The patient is intubated with an endotracheal tube in satisfactory position. These findings in the context of tetanus reflect the severe musculoskeletal consequences of sustained muscle spasms, which can generate sufficient force to fracture vertebral bodies.
