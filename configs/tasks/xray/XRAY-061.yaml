reference_solution: |
  PA chest radiograph demonstrates a prominent tortuous thoracic aorta with
  extensive atherosclerotic wall calcification, which could initially mimic
  mediastinal widening or aortic aneurysm. However, the aortic wall calcification
  traces the true outer margin of the aorta, and when the tortuosity is accounted
  for, there is no focal aneurysmal dilatation. The mediastinal width is within
  normal limits for the degree of aortic ectasia. No pleural cap or tracheal
  compression. The lung fields are clear. No pleural effusion. The cardiac
  silhouette is within normal limits. This represents age-related atherosclerotic
  change and is not concerning for acute aortic pathology.
  Impression: Tortuous calcified aorta — atherosclerotic change, no true
  mediastinal widening or aneurysm.
