reference_solution: |
  Frontal chest radiograph (supine/AP) demonstrates near-complete opacification of the left hemithorax consistent with a massive hemothorax. There is mediastinal shift to the right. The cardiac silhouette appears small, suggesting hypovolemia. Multiple left-sided rib fractures are identified, likely the source of hemorrhage. These findings in the trauma setting are consistent with hemorrhagic shock from massive hemothorax requiring emergent chest tube placement.
