reference_solution: |
  Radiograph of the right lower extremity demonstrates extensive soft tissue gas tracking along the fascial planes of the leg, appearing as linear lucencies within the deep soft tissues. Marked soft tissue swelling is present. No fracture, foreign body, or prior surgical site is identified to account for the gas. These findings are characteristic of necrotizing fasciitis or gas-producing soft tissue infection and represent a surgical emergency requiring immediate operative debridement.
