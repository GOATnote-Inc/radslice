reference_solution: |
  Lateral cervical spine radiograph demonstrates anterolisthesis at C5-C6 with disruption of the anterior and posterior vertebral body lines. Prevertebral soft tissue swelling is noted measuring greater than 7 mm at C2 and greater than 21 mm at C6. A compression fracture of the C6 vertebral body is present. These findings indicate an unstable cervical spine injury with high likelihood of spinal cord involvement. MRI is urgently indicated to evaluate the spinal cord, and spine immobilization must be maintained.
