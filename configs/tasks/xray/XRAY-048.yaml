reference_solution: |
  Frontal chest radiograph of an infant demonstrates bilateral pulmonary hyperinflation with flattened hemidiaphragms. Peribronchial thickening is prominent bilaterally with streaky perihilar opacities. Patchy subsegmental atelectasis is noted in the right middle lobe region. No focal lobar consolidation or pleural effusion is identified. These findings are classic for bronchiolitis in the appropriate clinical setting of an infant with respiratory distress.
