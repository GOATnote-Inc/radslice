reference_solution: |
  Frontal chest radiograph demonstrates acute bilateral alveolar and interstitial pulmonary edema with a normal or only mildly enlarged cardiac silhouette, suggesting flash pulmonary edema. This pattern, particularly with a non-dilated heart, raises concern for acute valvular regurgitation such as acute mitral regurgitation from chordal rupture or papillary muscle dysfunction. Urgent echocardiography is recommended for definitive evaluation.
