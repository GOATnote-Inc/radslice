reference_solution: |
  Frontal chest radiograph demonstrates cardiomegaly with mild pulmonary vascular congestion. No focal consolidation or pleural effusion is identified. If a pacemaker is present, the lead positions should be evaluated for appropriate placement. In the clinical context of unstable bradycardia, these findings suggest hemodynamic compromise with early pulmonary congestion. Electrocardiographic correlation is essential.
