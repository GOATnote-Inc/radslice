reference_solution: |
  Radiograph of the right lower extremity demonstrates mild soft tissue swelling in the region of the calf musculature. The osseous structures are normal in alignment and appearance with no fracture, dislocation, or avulsion injury identified. Joint spaces are preserved. The findings on X-ray are consistent with soft tissue injury such as muscle strain, and the radiograph primarily serves to exclude fracture. Ultrasound or MRI may be considered if clinical concern for significant muscle tear persists.
