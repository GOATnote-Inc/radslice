reference_solution: |
  Frontal chest radiograph demonstrates marked bilateral pulmonary hyperinflation with flattened hemidiaphragms and a barrel-chest configuration. Emphysematous bullous changes are noted in the upper lobes. Peribronchial thickening is present bilaterally. The cardiac silhouette is vertically oriented and elongated. No focal consolidation or pneumothorax is identified. These findings are consistent with underlying COPD, and the peribronchial thickening suggests an acute exacerbation.
