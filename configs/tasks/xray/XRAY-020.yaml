reference_solution: |
  Frontal chest radiograph demonstrates a thin visceral pleural line at the right
  apex with absence of lung markings peripheral to this line, consistent with a
  right apical pneumothorax. The pneumothorax appears small to moderate in size.
  There is no mediastinal shift or tracheal deviation to suggest tension physiology.
  The left lung is fully expanded and clear. No rib fractures or subcutaneous
  emphysema identified. No pleural effusion. The finding should be distinguished
  from a skin fold artifact, which typically extends beyond the lung margin and
  does not demonstrate a sharp visceral pleural line. Clinical correlation and
  follow-up imaging recommended to assess for interval change.
