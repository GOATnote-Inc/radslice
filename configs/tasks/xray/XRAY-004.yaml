reference_solution: |
  Frontal chest radiograph demonstrates widening of the superior mediastinum with an abnormal aortic contour and indistinct aortic knob. A left-sided pleural effusion is present. The trachea is deviated slightly to the right. These findings are concerning for aortic dissection, and urgent cross-sectional imaging with CT angiography is recommended for definitive diagnosis.
