reference_solution: |
  AP and lateral radiographs of the right lower leg demonstrate a comminuted fracture of the tibial shaft with moderate displacement. There is marked soft tissue swelling surrounding the fracture site with loss of normal fascial plane visualization. No subcutaneous gas is identified. In the clinical setting of severe pain out of proportion to the fracture, these imaging findings combined with the fracture pattern raise concern for compartment syndrome. Compartment pressure measurement is the diagnostic standard and should not be delayed for additional imaging.
