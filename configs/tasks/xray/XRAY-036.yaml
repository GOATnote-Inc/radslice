reference_solution: |
  PA chest radiograph demonstrates a thick-walled cavitary lesion in the right
  upper lobe measuring approximately 4 cm in diameter. The cavity walls are
  irregular in thickness, with the thickest portion measuring over 1 cm. An
  air-fluid level is present within the cavity. There is surrounding parenchymal
  consolidation/opacification adjacent to the cavity. No additional cavitary
  lesions or satellite nodules are identified. The left lung is clear. No pleural
  effusion or pneumothorax. The mediastinum appears normal. The differential
  diagnosis includes cavitary tuberculosis, lung abscess, cavitary squamous cell
  carcinoma, and granulomatosis with polyangiitis. Sputum for AFB and cultures,
  CT chest, and consideration of bronchoscopy with biopsy are recommended.
  Impression: Thick-walled cavitary lesion in the right upper lobe — infectious
  versus neoplastic etiology. Further workup required.
