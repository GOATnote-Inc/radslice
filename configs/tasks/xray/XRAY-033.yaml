reference_solution: |
  PA chest radiograph demonstrates a prominent aortic contour with convex lateral
  bulging of the descending thoracic aorta and widening of the mediastinal
  silhouette, consistent with a thoracic aortic aneurysm. Mural calcification is
  visible along the dilated aortic wall. There is mild rightward tracheal
  deviation secondary to mass effect from the aneurysm. No associated pleural
  effusion or hemothorax. The lung fields are clear. The cardiac silhouette is
  borderline enlarged. The aneurysm appears to involve the descending thoracic
  aorta. CT angiography of the chest is recommended to precisely measure the
  aneurysm diameter, assess for mural thrombus, and guide surgical planning.
  Vascular surgery consultation is warranted.
  Impression: Thoracic aortic aneurysm of the descending aorta — CTA recommended.
