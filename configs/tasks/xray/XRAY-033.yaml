reference_solution: |
  Abdominal radiograph demonstrates pneumatosis intestinalis with linear and bubbly gas within the walls of multiple small bowel loops. Branching linear lucencies projecting over the liver suggest portal venous gas. Several bowel loops appear dilated and featureless. These findings are highly concerning for advanced mesenteric ischemia with bowel necrosis. Urgent CT angiography and surgical consultation are indicated, as this represents a surgical emergency.
