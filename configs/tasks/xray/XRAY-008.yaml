reference_solution: |
  Frontal chest radiograph demonstrates marked cardiomegaly with bilateral pulmonary vascular congestion and interstitial edema. Bilateral pleural effusions are present. In the clinical context of a peripartum patient, these findings are consistent with peripartum cardiomyopathy. Echocardiography is recommended for assessment of ventricular function and ejection fraction.
