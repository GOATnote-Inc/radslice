reference_solution: |
  PA chest radiograph demonstrates a linear opacity with a woven or braided
  pattern overlying the right upper lung zone. This opacity extends beyond the
  thoracic cage margins, confirming it is external to the patient and represents
  a hair braid artifact. No true pulmonary parenchymal abnormality is identified
  once the artifact is recognized. The lungs are clear bilaterally. No pleural
  effusion, pneumothorax, or true mass. The cardiac silhouette is normal. A
  repeat radiograph with the hair repositioned away from the chest can be obtained
  if there is clinical concern, though the artifact pattern is characteristic.
  Impression: Hair braid artifact — no true pulmonary abnormality.
