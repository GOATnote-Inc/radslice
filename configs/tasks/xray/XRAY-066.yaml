reference_solution: |
  Radiographs of the bilateral lower extremities demonstrate comminuted fractures of the right femur and left tibia with extensive surrounding soft tissue swelling and loss of normal fascial plane definition. No subcutaneous gas is identified. In the setting of prolonged entrapment (mass casualty or structural collapse), these findings indicate crush injury with high risk for crush syndrome upon release. Aggressive fluid resuscitation and monitoring for hyperkalemia, metabolic acidosis, and acute kidney injury from rhabdomyolysis are critical prior to and during extrication.
