reference_solution: |
  AP and lateral radiographs of the left knee demonstrate a large joint effusion with distension of the suprapatellar bursa. Periarticular soft tissue swelling is present. The joint space is maintained and no erosive changes or periarticular osteopenia are identified, suggesting an acute process. No fracture or gas within the joint is seen. In the clinical setting of fever and acute monoarticular arthritis, these findings are concerning for septic arthritis. Urgent joint aspiration for synovial fluid analysis is mandatory.
