reference_solution: |
  PA chest radiograph demonstrates multiple rib fractures involving the left 4th
  through 7th ribs, with segmental (two fracture sites per rib) fractures of the
  5th and 6th ribs, creating a flail segment along the left lateral chest wall.
  There is associated hazy opacification in the left lower zone adjacent to the
  fracture sites, consistent with pulmonary contusion. Subtle subcutaneous
  emphysema is noted along the left lateral chest wall soft tissues. No definite
  pneumothorax or large hemothorax is identified, though a small component
  cannot be excluded. The right lung is clear. The mediastinum is midline.
  Clinical management should include pain control and monitoring for
  respiratory compromise related to the flail physiology.
  Impression: Flail chest with multiple left-sided rib fractures and associated
  pulmonary contusion.
