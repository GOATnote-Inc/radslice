reference_solution: |
  AP and lateral radiographs of the left forearm demonstrate displaced comminuted fractures of both the radius and ulna at the mid-diaphysis. Subcutaneous air is identified within the soft tissues adjacent to the fracture site, indicating communication with the external environment and confirming an open fracture. No radiopaque foreign body is identified. Urgent surgical consultation for debridement and fixation is required, along with tetanus prophylaxis and antibiotic administration.
