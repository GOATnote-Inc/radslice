reference_solution: |
  Frontal chest radiograph demonstrates bilateral pulmonary hyperinflation with flattened hemidiaphragms and increased intercostal spacing. Peribronchial thickening is noted bilaterally. The lung fields are clear without focal consolidation or pneumothorax. No pneumomediastinum is identified. These findings are consistent with acute air trapping as seen in an asthma exacerbation.
