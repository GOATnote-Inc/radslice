reference_solution: |
  Frontal chest radiograph demonstrates cardiomegaly with prominence of the left atrial appendage and a double density sign at the right heart border consistent with left atrial enlargement. There is mild pulmonary vascular congestion. No focal consolidation or pleural effusion is identified. These findings are consistent with underlying atrial enlargement, commonly seen in the setting of atrial fibrillation. Clinical and electrocardiographic correlation is recommended.
