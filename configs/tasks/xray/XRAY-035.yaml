reference_solution: |
  Lateral lumbar spine radiograph demonstrates anterior wedge compression of the L1 vertebral body with approximately 40% loss of anterior height. The posterior vertebral body height is maintained. No retropulsion of bone fragments is identified on this view. No lytic or blastic lesions are seen to suggest pathologic fracture. The remaining vertebral body heights and disc spaces are preserved. MRI is recommended to assess for posterior ligamentous injury and to exclude pathologic etiology.
