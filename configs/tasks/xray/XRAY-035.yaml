reference_solution: |
  Portable AP chest radiograph demonstrates a left subclavian central venous
  catheter with the tip projecting over the right atrium, well below the expected
  cavoatrial junction. The ideal position for the catheter tip is at the SVC-right
  atrial junction. The current deep positioning risks arrhythmia, cardiac
  perforation, and tamponade. No pneumothorax related to catheter placement. The
  lungs are otherwise clear. No pleural effusion. Heart size is within normal
  limits. An additional nasogastric tube is present with tip below the diaphragm
  in satisfactory position. Withdrawal of the central venous catheter by
  approximately 3-4 cm is recommended.
  Impression: Malpositioned central venous catheter with tip in the right atrium —
  repositioning recommended.
