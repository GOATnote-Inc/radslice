reference_solution: |
  Frontal chest radiograph demonstrates a radiopaque foreign body consistent with a projectile fragment in the left hemithorax. There is a left-sided hemopneumothorax with an air-fluid level. Subcutaneous emphysema is noted along the left chest wall. No mediastinal widening is identified. Emergent chest tube placement and surgical consultation are warranted given the penetrating mechanism and hemopneumothorax.
