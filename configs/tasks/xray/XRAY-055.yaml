reference_solution: |
  Frontal chest radiograph demonstrates bilateral diffuse alveolar opacities consistent with non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema. The cardiac silhouette is normal in size, supporting a non-cardiogenic etiology. No pneumothorax is identified. In the clinical context of submersion injury, these findings represent a combination of aspirated fluid and surfactant disruption leading to pulmonary edema. Serial imaging is recommended, as ARDS may develop over the subsequent 24-48 hours.
