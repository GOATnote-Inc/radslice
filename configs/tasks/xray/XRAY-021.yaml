reference_solution: |
  Lateral soft tissue neck radiograph demonstrates a markedly swollen epiglottis with the classic thumbprint sign, replacing the normal thin epiglottic shadow. The aryepiglottic folds are thickened. The subglottic airway is normal without the steeple sign of croup. No prevertebral soft tissue widening to suggest retropharyngeal abscess. These findings are diagnostic of acute epiglottitis, and airway management should be the immediate priority.
