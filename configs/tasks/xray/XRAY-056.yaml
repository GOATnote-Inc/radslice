reference_solution: |
  Frontal chest radiograph demonstrates lucency within the right heart chambers, consistent with intracardiac air. Air is also visible within the main pulmonary artery. A central venous catheter is in situ with tip in the superior vena cava. No pneumomediastinum or pneumothorax is identified. These findings are consistent with venous air embolism, likely iatrogenic related to the central venous catheter. Immediate positioning in left lateral decubitus with head down (Durant maneuver) and attempted aspiration of air through the central line are indicated.
