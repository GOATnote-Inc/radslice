reference_solution: |
  Frontal chest radiograph demonstrates cortical disruption involving the left 6th and
  7th ribs in the lateral aspect, consistent with acute fractures. The left 7th rib
  fracture shows mild displacement of the fracture fragments. There is subtle adjacent
  soft tissue swelling along the left lateral chest wall. No associated pneumothorax
  or pleural effusion is identified. Lungs are clear bilaterally. No flail segment.
  Clinical correlation for pain management and follow-up recommended.
