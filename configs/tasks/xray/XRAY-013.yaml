reference_solution: |
  Lateral skull radiograph demonstrates a linear lucency traversing the temporal bone consistent with a non-depressed linear skull fracture. The fracture line crosses the groove of the middle meningeal artery, raising high suspicion for an associated epidural hematoma. Overlying soft tissue swelling is noted. Urgent CT of the head is mandatory to evaluate for intracranial hemorrhage, as skull radiography cannot directly visualize the epidural collection.
