reference_solution: |
  PA chest radiograph demonstrates an asymmetric soft tissue opacity at the left
  lung apex, measuring over 5 mm in thickness, significantly greater than the
  contralateral right apex. This is not a simple apical pleural cap, as the
  opacity is unilateral, thick, and has a convex inferior margin. Close inspection
  reveals destruction of the left posterior 2nd rib. These findings are highly
  suspicious for a Pancoast (superior sulcus) tumor. The remainder of the lung
  fields are clear. No mediastinal widening or pleural effusion. The cardiac
  silhouette is normal. Urgent contrast-enhanced CT of the chest with extension
  through the thoracic inlet and MRI of the brachial plexus are recommended for
  staging and surgical planning. Tissue biopsy is essential.
  Impression: Left apical mass — Pancoast tumor suspected. Urgent CT and MRI
  recommended.
