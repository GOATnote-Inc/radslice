  provided_report: >
    CT pulmonary angiogram: There is a small filling defect identified within the right
    lower lobe segmental pulmonary artery, consistent with a subsegmental pulmonary embolism.
    No evidence of right heart strain. The main pulmonary artery caliber is within normal
    limits. The lungs are clear without consolidation or ground-glass opacity. No pleural
    effusion. Impression: Small subsegmental pulmonary embolism in the right lower lobe.
    Recommend anticoagulation per clinical protocol.
  report_errors:
    - error_type: severity_underestimate
      claim: "Small filling defect within the right lower lobe segmental pulmonary artery, consistent with a subsegmental pulmonary embolism"
      correction: "The filling defect is a large saddle embolus straddling the main pulmonary artery bifurcation with extension into bilateral pulmonary arteries, not a small subsegmental PE"
      severity: critical
    - error_type: missed_finding
      claim: "No evidence of right heart strain"
      correction: "Right ventricular dilatation with interventricular septal bowing toward the left ventricle is present, indicating acute right heart strain"
      severity: critical
