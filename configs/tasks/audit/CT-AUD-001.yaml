  negatives:
    - "No pleural effusion"

  provided_report: >
    CT chest with contrast: The lungs are clear bilaterally with no focal consolidation or
    ground-glass opacity. The airways are patent to the subsegmental level. No pleural effusion
    is identified. The mediastinal structures are unremarkable without lymphadenopathy. The
    visualized osseous structures are intact. Heart size is normal. Impression: Normal chest CT
    with no acute cardiopulmonary findings.
  report_errors:
    - error_type: missed_finding
      claim: "The lungs are clear bilaterally with no focal consolidation"
      correction: "A 12 mm spiculated nodule is present in the right upper lobe and should have been reported with recommendation for follow-up or tissue sampling"
