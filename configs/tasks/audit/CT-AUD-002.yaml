  provided_report: >
    Frontal chest radiograph: There is a visible pleural line along the right apex with
    absence of lung markings lateral to this line, consistent with a right-sided pneumothorax.
    The right lung appears partially collapsed. No mediastinal shift is identified.
    The left lung is clear. Heart size is within normal limits. No acute osseous abnormality.
    Impression: Right-sided pneumothorax without tension physiology. Clinical correlation and
    consideration of chest tube placement recommended.
  report_errors:
    - error_type: wrong_laterality
      claim: "Right-sided pneumothorax"
      correction: "The pneumothorax is left-sided; the pleural line and absent lung markings are in the left hemithorax, not the right"
      severity: critical
    - error_type: missed_finding
      claim: "The left lung is clear"
      correction: "The left lung is the affected side with visible pleural line and absent peripheral lung markings indicating a left pneumothorax"
      severity: major
