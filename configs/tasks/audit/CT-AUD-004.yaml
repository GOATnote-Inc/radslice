  provided_report: >
    CT chest without contrast: There is an ill-defined soft tissue mass in the right lower
    lobe measuring approximately 3.2 x 2.8 cm, concerning for primary pulmonary malignancy.
    Recommend PET-CT for further characterization. The remainder of the lungs are clear without
    additional nodules or consolidation. No pleural effusion. The mediastinum is unremarkable
    without significant lymphadenopathy. The heart is normal in size. The visualized upper
    abdomen is unremarkable. Impression: Right lower lobe mass suspicious for malignancy;
    PET-CT recommended.
  report_errors:
    - error_type: hallucinated_finding
      claim: "Ill-defined soft tissue mass in the right lower lobe measuring approximately 3.2 x 2.8 cm"
      correction: "No mass or nodule is present in the right lower lobe; the lung parenchyma is normal throughout. This finding is fabricated and would lead to unnecessary invasive workup"
      severity: critical
    - error_type: wrong_diagnosis
      claim: "Right lower lobe mass suspicious for malignancy; PET-CT recommended"
      correction: "The chest CT is normal with no mass, nodule, or other abnormality requiring further imaging workup"
      severity: critical
