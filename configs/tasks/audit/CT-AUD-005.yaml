  severity: moderate
  laterality: null
  negatives:
    - "No focal consolidation"
    - "No pneumothorax"
    - "No acute rib fractures"
  provided_report: >
    PA chest radiograph: The lungs are clear bilaterally without focal consolidation,
    pleural effusion, or pneumothorax. The heart size is within normal limits. The
    mediastinal contours are unremarkable. There is mild upper lobe pulmonary venous
    distension which may be positional. No acute osseous abnormality is seen. Impression:
    No acute cardiopulmonary disease.
  report_errors:
    - error_type: missed_finding
      claim: "The heart size is within normal limits"
      correction: "The cardiac silhouette is enlarged with a cardiothoracic ratio exceeding 0.5, consistent with cardiomegaly. This was not reported"
      severity: critical
    - error_type: severity_underestimate
      claim: "Mild upper lobe pulmonary venous distension which may be positional"
      correction: "Upper lobe pulmonary venous cephalization in the setting of cardiomegaly is more likely due to elevated left atrial pressure than patient positioning, and should prompt consideration of congestive heart failure"
      severity: major
