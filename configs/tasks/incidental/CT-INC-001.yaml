reference_solution: |
  Contrast-enhanced CT of the abdomen demonstrates multiple hyperdense calcified gallstones within the gallbladder lumen. The gallbladder wall is not thickened and there is no pericholecystic fluid or stranding to suggest acute cholecystitis. The common bile duct measures within normal limits with no intra- or extrahepatic biliary dilatation.

  Incidental findings:
  1. The hepatic parenchyma demonstrates diffusely decreased attenuation measuring approximately 30 HU, which is lower than the splenic attenuation. This is consistent with moderate-to-severe hepatic steatosis. Clinical correlation with metabolic risk factors and hepatitis serologies is recommended.
  2. A 1.2 cm simple-appearing hypodense lesion in the right kidney lower pole with water attenuation and imperceptible wall is consistent with a Bosniak I simple renal cyst. No follow-up is required.
