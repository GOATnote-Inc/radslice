reference_solution: |
  Contrast-enhanced CT of the abdomen demonstrates a 4.2 x 3.8 cm heterogeneously enhancing exophytic solid mass arising from the upper pole of the left kidney with central areas of low attenuation suggesting necrosis. The mass is suspicious for renal cell carcinoma. The left renal vein and inferior vena cava are patent without evidence of tumor thrombus. No retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy is identified. No hepatic lesions suspicious for metastatic disease.

  Incidental findings:
  1. A 2.1 cm well-circumscribed homogeneous low-attenuation nodule in the right adrenal gland measures approximately 8 HU on the unenhanced phase, consistent with a lipid-rich adrenal adenoma. While the unenhanced attenuation is diagnostic of adenoma, given the concurrent renal malignancy, an adrenal protocol CT with washout analysis or chemical shift MRI may be considered to definitively exclude metastatic disease.
  2. There is loss of approximately 25% of the L1 vertebral body height with mild retropulsion but no significant spinal canal compromise, consistent with a compression fracture. In the setting of a known renal malignancy, MRI of the lumbar spine is recommended to differentiate an osteoporotic compression fracture from a pathologic fracture. DEXA scan for osteoporosis evaluation is also recommended.
