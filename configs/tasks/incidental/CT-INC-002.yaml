reference_solution: |
  CT of the chest in bone and soft tissue windows demonstrates a non-displaced cortical disruption involving the right lateral seventh rib with mild adjacent soft tissue swelling, consistent with an acute rib fracture. No pneumothorax or pleural effusion is identified. No additional rib fractures or sternal fracture.

  Incidental findings:
  1. An 8 mm solid non-calcified pulmonary nodule is noted in the right upper lobe. In the absence of a known primary malignancy, follow-up CT chest in 3-6 months is recommended per Fleischner Society guidelines. If the patient is high-risk (smoking history, occupational exposure), earlier follow-up or PET-CT may be considered.
  2. A 1.5 cm low-attenuation nodule is identified in the left thyroid lobe, partially visualized on the chest CT. Dedicated thyroid ultrasound is recommended for further characterization per ACR guidelines for incidental thyroid nodules detected on CT.
