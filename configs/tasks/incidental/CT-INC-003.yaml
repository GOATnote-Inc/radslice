reference_solution: |
  Contrast-enhanced CT of the abdomen and pelvis demonstrates a dilated fluid-filled appendix measuring 11 mm in maximal diameter with mural hyperenhancement and surrounding periappendiceal fat stranding. An appendicolith is noted at the appendiceal base. There is no extraluminal air, abscess formation, or free intraperitoneal fluid to suggest perforation. Findings are consistent with acute uncomplicated appendicitis.

  Incidental findings:
  1. A 2.3 cm well-circumscribed homogeneous hypodense lesion in the left kidney interpolar region with water attenuation (approximately 5 HU) and an imperceptible wall is consistent with a Bosniak I simple renal cyst. No follow-up is necessary.
  2. An 1.8 cm well-defined hypodense lesion in segment VI of the right hepatic lobe demonstrates peripheral nodular discontinuous enhancement with progressive centripetal fill-in, a pattern characteristic of a hepatic hemangioma. No further workup is required given the classic imaging features.
