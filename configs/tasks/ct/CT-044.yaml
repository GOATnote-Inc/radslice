reference_solution: |
  CT of the lumbar spine demonstrates a compression fracture of the L1 vertebral body with approximately 50% loss of height. Lytic destruction of the posterior vertebral body cortex is present, raising concern for a pathologic fracture. A soft tissue component extends into the anterior epidural space. The conus medullaris terminates above this level. No additional fractures are identified. Given the lytic nature, findings are concerning for pathologic compression fracture, possibly from metastatic disease or myeloma, warranting urgent MRI and oncologic evaluation.
