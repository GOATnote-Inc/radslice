reference_solution: |
  Contrast-enhanced trauma CT of the abdomen demonstrates a deep laceration
  through the right hepatic lobe involving segments 5, 6, 7, and 8 with
  the laceration plane extending to the right hepatic vein, consistent with
  AAST Grade IV hepatic injury. There is a focus of active contrast
  extravasation within the laceration bed measuring approximately 1.5 cm,
  indicating ongoing arterial hemorrhage. A large perihepatic hematoma
  surrounds the right lobe of the liver. Free fluid consistent with
  hemoperitoneum is present in bilateral paracolic gutters, Morrison pouch,
  and the pelvis. The spleen, bilateral kidneys, and pancreas appear
  intact. No IVC injury identified. No retroperitoneal hemorrhage.
  Impression: AAST Grade IV right hepatic laceration with active
  extravasation and significant hemoperitoneum. Emergent interventional
  radiology consultation for hepatic angioembolization or surgical
  exploration. Massive transfusion protocol should be considered.
