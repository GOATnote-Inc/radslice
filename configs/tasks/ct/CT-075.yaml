reference_solution: |
  Contrast-enhanced CT of the abdomen demonstrates a small, densely calcified spleen consistent with autosplenectomy from chronic sickle cell disease with superimposed peripheral wedge-shaped hypodense areas representing acute splenic infarcts. Diffuse medullary expansion of the axial skeleton with decreased marrow attenuation reflects extramedullary hematopoiesis. Pigmented gallstones are present. No findings of acute chest syndrome are identified. Findings are consistent with acute sickle cell crisis complicated by splenic infarction.
