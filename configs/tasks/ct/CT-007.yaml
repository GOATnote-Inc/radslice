reference_solution: |
  Non-contrast CT of the abdomen and pelvis demonstrates a 7 mm hyperdense
  calculus at the left ureteropelvic junction. There is associated moderate
  left hydronephrosis with dilatation of the renal pelvis and calyces. The
  left proximal ureter is dilated to the level of the stone. Mild
  perinephric fat stranding is noted surrounding the left kidney, indicating
  acute obstruction. The right kidney is normal without hydronephrosis or
  calculi. The bladder is normally distended without calculi.
  Impression: Obstructing 7 mm left ureteropelvic junction calculus with
  moderate hydronephrosis and perinephric stranding, consistent with acute
  left ureteral obstruction. Urology consultation recommended.
