reference_solution: |
  CTA of the abdomen and pelvis demonstrates a large fusiform infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm measuring approximately 7.5 cm in maximal diameter with eccentric mural thrombus. There is a large high-attenuation left retroperitoneal hematoma with a focus of active contrast extravasation from the posterior aspect of the aneurysm sac, consistent with active rupture. No free intraperitoneal fluid is identified. Findings are consistent with ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm requiring emergent vascular surgery.
