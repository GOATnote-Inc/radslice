reference_solution: |
  Contrast-enhanced CT of the abdomen demonstrates dilatation of the intrahepatic and extrahepatic bile ducts with a hyperdense calculus impacted in the distal common bile duct. There is thickening and hyperenhancement of the common bile duct wall. No hepatic abscess is identified. The gallbladder contains additional calculi. In the clinical setting of Charcot triad (fever, jaundice, RUQ pain), findings are consistent with ascending cholangitis secondary to choledocholithiasis requiring emergent biliary decompression.
