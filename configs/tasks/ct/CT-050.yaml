reference_solution: |
  Contrast-enhanced CT of the right knee demonstrates a complex joint effusion with diffuse synovial thickening and enhancement, concerning for septic arthritis. There is extensive periarticular soft tissue edema and fat stranding. No cortical destruction or sequestrum formation to suggest osteomyelitis is identified. No intra-articular gas is present. Findings are highly suspicious for septic arthritis requiring emergent arthrocentesis for definitive diagnosis and intravenous antibiotic therapy.
