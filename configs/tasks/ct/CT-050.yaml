reference_solution: |
  Contrast-enhanced CT of the abdomen and pelvis demonstrates a massively
  dilated sigmoid colon forming an inverted-U configuration extending from
  the pelvis into the upper abdomen, consistent with sigmoid volvulus. The
  classic whirl sign is present at the point of mesenteric torsion in the
  left lower quadrant, with the mesenteric vessels converging at the twist
  point. On coronal images, the coffee bean sign is evident with the
  dilated sigmoid loop mimicking a coffee bean shape. The rectum is
  decompressed. The remaining colon proximal to the sigmoid is mildly
  dilated. The sigmoid wall enhances normally without evidence of ischemia
  or pneumatosis. No free intraperitoneal air suggesting perforation. No
  colonic mass identified at the transition point.
  Impression: Sigmoid volvulus with classic whirl sign and massively dilated
  sigmoid loop without evidence of ischemia or perforation. Urgent
  endoscopic decompression with rectal tube placement recommended as
  initial management, with surgical consultation for definitive treatment.
