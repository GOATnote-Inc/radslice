reference_solution: |
  Non-contrast CT of the abdomen and pelvis demonstrates a 7 mm hyperdense calculus at the left ureterovesical junction with surrounding periureteral stranding (tissue rim sign). There is moderate left hydroureteronephrosis proximal to the obstructing stone. No additional calculi are identified. The right kidney and collecting system are normal. Findings are consistent with an obstructing left distal ureteral calculus causing acute left renal colic.
