reference_solution: |
  ECG-gated CT aortography demonstrates an intimal flap within the ascending
  aorta originating approximately 2 cm above the aortic root, creating true
  and false lumens with differential contrast opacification. The dissection
  flap extends through the aortic arch and into the proximal descending
  thoracic aorta. The true lumen is compressed with the false lumen being
  larger. A small pericardial effusion is present raising concern for
  hemopericardium. The coronary artery ostia appear to arise from the true
  lumen. No active extravasation to suggest rupture. The great vessels
  appear patent.
  Impression: Stanford type A aortic dissection involving the ascending
  aorta and arch with small pericardial effusion. Emergent cardiovascular
  surgical consultation is required.
