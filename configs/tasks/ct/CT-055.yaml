reference_solution: |
  Contrast-enhanced CT of the abdomen demonstrates a rim-enhancing hypodense collection within the upper pole of the right kidney measuring approximately 3.5 cm, consistent with a renal abscess. Perinephric fat stranding and thickening of the right Gerota fascia are present. No perinephric extension of the abscess is identified. The right collecting system is not obstructed. Findings are consistent with a complicated urinary tract infection with renal abscess formation requiring IV antibiotics and possible percutaneous drainage.
