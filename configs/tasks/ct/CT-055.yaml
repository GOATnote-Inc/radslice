reference_solution: |
  High-resolution CT of the chest demonstrates bilateral predominantly
  peripheral ground-glass opacities affecting the bilateral lower lobes and
  right middle lobe. The opacities are multifocal and patchy with some
  areas showing a crazy-paving pattern (ground-glass opacity with
  superimposed interlobular septal thickening). Subpleural sparing is noted
  in several areas. No significant consolidation or cavitation. No pleural
  effusion. No mediastinal or hilar lymphadenopathy. The upper lobes are
  relatively spared. No tree-in-bud opacities to suggest bacterial
  bronchopneumonia. No honeycombing or traction bronchiectasis to suggest
  fibrotic disease. The airways are patent.
  Impression: Bilateral peripheral ground-glass opacities with crazy-paving
  pattern and lower lobe predominance, consistent with viral pneumonia in
  the appropriate clinical context. Differential includes organizing
  pneumonia and drug-induced pneumonitis. Clinical correlation with
  respiratory pathogen testing recommended.
