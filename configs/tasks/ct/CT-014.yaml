reference_solution: |
  Contrast-enhanced CT of the abdomen demonstrates a diffusely enlarged
  pancreas with heterogeneous enhancement. A large area of non-enhancement
  involving approximately 50% of the pancreatic body is identified,
  consistent with pancreatic parenchymal necrosis. There is extensive
  peripancreatic fat stranding and fluid tracking into the anterior pararenal
  space bilaterally. An acute peripancreatic fluid collection is present in
  the lesser sac measuring approximately 6 x 4 cm. No evidence of
  pseudoaneurysm or active hemorrhage. The portal and splenic veins remain
  patent. No biliary obstruction. CT severity index (Balthazar) is estimated
  at 8, indicating severe disease.
  Impression: Acute necrotizing pancreatitis with approximately 50%
  parenchymal necrosis and peripancreatic fluid collections. ICU admission
  and close monitoring recommended.
