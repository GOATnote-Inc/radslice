reference_solution: |
  Contrast-enhanced CT of the thoracic spine demonstrates a lytic lesion of the T8 vertebral body with pathologic compression fracture and retropulsion of bone fragments into the spinal canal causing severe spinal canal stenosis. An enhancing epidural soft tissue component extends posteriorly, compressing the spinal cord. No additional levels of cord compression are identified. Findings are consistent with metastatic spinal cord compression requiring emergent neurosurgical or radiation oncology consultation.
