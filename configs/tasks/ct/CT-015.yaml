reference_solution: |
  Contrast-enhanced CT of the abdomen and pelvis demonstrates multiple
  dilated fluid-filled small bowel loops measuring up to 4.2 cm in
  diameter, predominantly involving the jejunum and proximal ileum. A
  discrete transition point is identified in the mid-ileum at the right
  lower quadrant, where an adhesive band is suspected as the cause of
  obstruction. Distal to this point, the small bowel is decompressed. A
  small bowel feces sign is present proximal to the transition point. The
  colon is decompressed and normal in caliber. No free intraperitoneal air
  to suggest perforation. The small bowel wall enhances normally without
  evidence of ischemia or strangulation. No hernia identified.
  Impression: High-grade small bowel obstruction with transition point in
  the mid-ileum, likely adhesive in etiology. No evidence of strangulation
  or closed-loop obstruction. Surgical consultation recommended.
