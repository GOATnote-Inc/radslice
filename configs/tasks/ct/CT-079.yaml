reference_solution: |
  CT of the chest demonstrates patchy bilateral ground-glass opacities with a central and perihilar predominance. The opacities are distributed in a non-dependent pattern, unlike typical cardiogenic edema. The cardiac silhouette is normal in size and no pleural effusions are present. Normal pulmonary artery caliber argues against chronic pulmonary hypertension. In the setting of rapid altitude ascent, findings are consistent with high-altitude pulmonary edema (HAPE) requiring descent and supplemental oxygen.
