reference_solution: |
  Contrast-enhanced CT of the left lower leg demonstrates diffuse enlargement and edema of the anterior compartment musculature with loss of normal intermuscular fascial plane definition. There is decreased enhancement of the anterior compartment muscles compared with the other compartments, suggesting impaired perfusion. An associated fracture of the proximal left tibia is present. No subcutaneous gas is identified. Findings are concerning for acute anterior compartment syndrome requiring emergent fasciotomy.
