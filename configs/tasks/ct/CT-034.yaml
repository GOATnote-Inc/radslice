reference_solution: |
  Contrast-enhanced CT of the chest with oral contrast demonstrates
  pneumomediastinum with gas tracking along the posterior mediastinal planes
  surrounding the esophagus. There is a focal defect in the left
  posterolateral wall of the distal esophagus approximately 3 cm above the
  gastroesophageal junction with extraluminal leak of oral contrast. A
  moderate left-sided pleural effusion with internal debris is present,
  suspicious for early empyema. Periesophageal fat stranding and fluid are
  noted in the posterior mediastinum. No pneumoperitoneum. The trachea and
  main bronchi appear intact. No esophageal mass to suggest underlying
  malignancy. The clinical history of forceful vomiting is consistent with
  Boerhaave syndrome.
  Impression: Esophageal perforation involving the left posterolateral
  distal esophagus with pneumomediastinum and left pleural effusion,
  consistent with Boerhaave syndrome. This is a surgical emergency requiring
  immediate thoracic surgery consultation for operative repair or endoscopic
  intervention.
