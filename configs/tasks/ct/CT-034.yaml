reference_solution: |
  Contrast-enhanced CT of the abdomen and pelvis demonstrates a dilated, fluid-filled appendix measuring approximately 10 mm in diameter with wall hyperenhancement and surrounding periappendiceal fat stranding. A small appendicolith is noted within the proximal appendiceal lumen. There is no extraluminal air, periappendiceal abscess, or free fluid to suggest perforation. Findings are consistent with acute uncomplicated appendicitis.
