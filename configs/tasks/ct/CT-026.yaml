reference_solution: |
  Contrast-enhanced CT of the neck demonstrates marked thickening and enhancement of the epiglottis with associated thickening of the aryepiglottic folds and narrowing of the supraglottic airway. No drainable fluid collection or abscess is identified. The subglottic airway is patent. Findings are consistent with acute epiglottitis with potential for airway compromise requiring emergent airway management and IV antibiotics.
