reference_solution: |
  CT of the chest demonstrates discontinuity of the posterior membranous wall of the distal trachea extending to the right mainstem bronchus origin. Extensive pneumomediastinum and subcutaneous emphysema are present throughout the chest wall and neck. There is a right pneumothorax with the right lung falling posteriorly and dependent in position (fallen lung sign). No esophageal perforation is identified. Findings are consistent with tracheobronchial disruption requiring emergent surgical repair.
