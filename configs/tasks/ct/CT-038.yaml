reference_solution: |
  CT of the abdomen and pelvis demonstrates dilated fluid-filled proximal small bowel loops measuring up to 4.5 cm in diameter with a discrete transition point in the distal ileum. The distal small bowel and colon are decompressed. A small bowel feces sign is noted near the transition point, suggesting a mechanical obstruction. There is no bowel wall thickening, reduced enhancement, or pneumatosis intestinalis to suggest strangulation. Findings are consistent with high-grade small bowel obstruction, likely from an adhesive band.
