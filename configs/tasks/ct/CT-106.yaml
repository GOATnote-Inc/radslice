reference_solution: |
  Non-contrast CT head of a neonate demonstrates diffuse cerebral edema with marked loss of gray-white matter differentiation throughout both cerebral hemispheres. The cerebellum and brainstem demonstrate relatively preserved density compared with the diffusely edematous cerebrum, producing the reversal sign (white cerebellum sign), which is an ominous finding. The basal cisterns and cortical sulci are effaced. No intracranial hemorrhage or congenital malformation is identified. Findings are consistent with severe neonatal hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy requiring therapeutic hypothermia and neuroprotective care.
