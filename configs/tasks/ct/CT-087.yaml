reference_solution: |
  Non-contrast CT of the chest demonstrates air within the right atrium, right ventricle, and main pulmonary arteries, consistent with significant venous air embolism. Air is also present in the segmental pulmonary arteries bilaterally. No pneumothorax or chest wall defect is identified as a source. The left heart chambers are free of air. In the clinical setting, findings represent a significant venous air embolism requiring immediate left lateral decubitus (Durant maneuver) positioning and consideration of hyperbaric oxygen therapy.
