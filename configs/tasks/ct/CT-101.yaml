reference_solution: |
  Contrast-enhanced CT of the abdomen demonstrates a bowel-within-bowel configuration (target sign) in the ascending colon with the intussusceptum containing mesenteric fat and engorged vessels projecting into the colonic lumen. Proximal ileal dilatation is present. No pneumatosis intestinalis or free air to suggest perforation or ischemic compromise is identified. No discrete lead-point mass is seen. Findings are consistent with ileocolic intussusception requiring emergent air or contrast enema reduction, or surgical consultation if reduction fails.
