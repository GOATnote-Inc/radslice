reference_solution: |
  Contrast-enhanced CT of the chest demonstrates an irregular low-attenuation mass on the aortic valve leaflet consistent with vegetation. Multiple bilateral peripheral wedge-shaped pulmonary opacities with early cavitation are present, consistent with septic emboli. Subtle perivalvular hypoattenuation at the aortic root raises concern for early abscess formation. No pseudoaneurysm identified. Findings are consistent with infective endocarditis complicated by septic pulmonary embolization.
