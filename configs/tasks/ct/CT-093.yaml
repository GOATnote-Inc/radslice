reference_solution: |
  CT of the chest in a neutropenic patient demonstrates multiple nodular opacities in bilateral lung fields, several of which are surrounded by a ground-glass halo (halo sign), characteristic of angioinvasive aspergillosis. A peripheral wedge-shaped consolidation is present in the right upper lobe consistent with pulmonary infarction from vessel invasion. No pleural effusion is identified. In the setting of prolonged neutropenia and fever unresponsive to broad-spectrum antibiotics, findings are highly suggestive of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis requiring empiric antifungal therapy.
