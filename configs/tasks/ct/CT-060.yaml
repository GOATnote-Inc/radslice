reference_solution: |
  Contrast-enhanced CT of the abdomen and pelvis demonstrates a markedly
  dilated cecum measuring approximately 12 cm in diameter, ectopically
  displaced to the left upper quadrant, crossing the midline. This is
  consistent with cecal volvulus (axial torsion type). The classic whirl
  sign is identified in the right lower quadrant where the ileocolic
  mesenteric vessels converge at the point of torsion. The ascending colon
  and transverse colon are decompressed. The terminal ileum is dilated
  proximally, suggesting a competent ileocecal valve causing secondary
  small bowel obstruction. The cecal wall enhances normally without evidence
  of pneumatosis or ischemia. No free intraperitoneal air. No colonic mass
  at the transition point. The sigmoid colon and rectum are normal in
  caliber, distinguishing this from sigmoid volvulus.
  Impression: Cecal volvulus with ectopic cecal displacement to the left
  upper quadrant and mesenteric whirl sign. Unlike sigmoid volvulus, cecal
  volvulus typically requires surgical intervention (right hemicolectomy) as
  endoscopic decompression is usually unsuccessful. Emergent surgical
  consultation required.
