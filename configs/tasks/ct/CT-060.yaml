reference_solution: |
  CT of the orbits demonstrates loss of the normal spherical contour of the left globe with flattening and irregularity of the posterior sclera. The left vitreous chamber is hyperdense compared with the right, consistent with intraocular hemorrhage. A small amount of intraocular air is present. No intraocular foreign body or retrobulbar hematoma is identified. Findings are consistent with open globe rupture of the left eye requiring emergent ophthalmologic consultation and surgical repair.
