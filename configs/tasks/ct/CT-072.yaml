reference_solution: |
  Non-contrast CT head of an infant demonstrates bilateral subdural collections of mixed densities: a hyperdense acute component along the right convexity and a hypodense chronic component along the left convexity, indicating hemorrhages of different ages. Diffuse cerebral edema with loss of gray-white matter differentiation is present. A non-displaced right parietal bone fracture is identified. The combination of bilateral subdural hematomas of varying ages in an infant is highly suspicious for non-accidental trauma (abusive head trauma) and requires immediate child protective services notification.
