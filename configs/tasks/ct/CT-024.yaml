reference_solution: |
  CT of the cervical spine demonstrates a C5 vertebral body fracture with grade 2 anterolisthesis of C5 on C6. Bilateral C5-C6 facet joint disruption is present with perched facets. There is significant spinal canal compromise at the C5-C6 level from retropulsed bone fragments. No vertebral artery injury is identified on CTA. Findings represent an unstable cervical spine fracture-dislocation with high likelihood of spinal cord injury requiring emergent neurosurgical consultation and spinal immobilization.
