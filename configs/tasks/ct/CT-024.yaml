reference_solution: |
  Contrast-enhanced CT angiography of the abdomen demonstrates acute
  thrombotic occlusion of the proximal superior mesenteric artery,
  approximately 2 cm from its origin. There is non-enhancement of multiple
  jejunal and proximal ileal loops indicating transmural infarction. The
  affected bowel walls are thinned and paper-like, consistent with
  irreversible ischemia. Pneumatosis intestinalis is identified in multiple
  loops of the affected jejunum. Portal venous gas is present within
  intrahepatic portal vein branches, a grave prognostic sign. There is
  haziness and fat stranding within the small bowel mesentery. The
  mesenteric venous system is patent. The distal ileum and colon appear
  normally perfused. No free intraperitoneal air.
  Impression: Acute SMA occlusion with extensive small bowel infarction,
  pneumatosis intestinalis, and portal venous gas. Emergent surgical
  exploration required. This represents a surgical emergency with high
  mortality risk.
