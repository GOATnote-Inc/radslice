reference_solution: |
  Contrast-enhanced CT of the neck demonstrates diffuse cellulitis and edema of the bilateral submandibular and sublingual spaces with thickening of the overlying platysma. The floor of the mouth is elevated with posterior displacement of the tongue toward the oropharyngeal airway, causing moderate airway narrowing. Small foci of gas are present within the submandibular soft tissues. No discrete drainable abscess is identified. Findings are consistent with Ludwig angina with impending airway compromise requiring emergent airway management.
