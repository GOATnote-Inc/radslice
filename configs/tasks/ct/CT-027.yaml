reference_solution: |
  CT of the chest demonstrates an intraluminal density within the right main bronchus consistent with an aspirated foreign body. There is associated right lower lobe atelectasis with air trapping on expiratory images. Mild post-obstructive inflammatory changes are present in the right lower lobe. No pneumomediastinum is identified. Findings confirm foreign body aspiration in the right main bronchus requiring urgent bronchoscopic retrieval.
