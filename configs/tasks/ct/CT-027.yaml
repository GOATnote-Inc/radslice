reference_solution: |
  Contrast-enhanced CT of the head demonstrates multiple ring-enhancing
  lesions located at the gray-white matter junction in bilateral cerebral
  hemispheres. The largest lesion in the right frontal lobe measures
  approximately 2.5 cm with irregular rim enhancement and central necrosis.
  Additional lesions are identified in the left parietal lobe (1.8 cm) and
  right occipital lobe (1.2 cm). There is extensive surrounding vasogenic
  edema causing mass effect with partial effacement of the right frontal
  horn. The gray-white matter junction distribution and multiplicity are
  highly characteristic of hematogenous metastatic disease. No
  leptomeningeal enhancement. Mild midline shift of approximately 3 mm
  leftward. No obstructive hydrocephalus.
  Impression: Multiple ring-enhancing lesions at the gray-white matter
  junction bilaterally, highly suspicious for cerebral metastases.
  Correlation with primary malignancy history recommended. MRI with
  gadolinium for further characterization and stereotactic planning.
