reference_solution: |
  Non-contrast CT of the abdomen and pelvis performed for evaluation of
  suspected renal colic demonstrates no renal, ureteral, or bladder
  calculus. The bilateral kidneys are normal in size (right 11 cm, left
  11.5 cm) with normal parenchymal attenuation. No hydronephrosis or
  hydroureter bilaterally. The bilateral ureters are not dilated and can be
  followed to the bladder without obstructing calculus. No perinephric
  stranding. The bladder is normally distended without intraluminal
  calculus. The appendix appears normal. No other acute abdominal pathology
  identified.
  Impression: Negative CT for urolithiasis. No stone, hydronephrosis, or
  perinephric stranding. Consider alternative etiology for flank pain.
