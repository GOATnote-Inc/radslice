reference_solution: |
  CTA of the head and neck demonstrates severe atherosclerotic stenosis at the left internal carotid artery origin with approximately 80% luminal narrowing and ulcerated plaque. The left ophthalmic artery demonstrates diminished caliber compared with the right. No carotid dissection or intracranial large vessel occlusion is identified. In the setting of acute painless monocular vision loss, findings are consistent with carotid artery plaque as the embolic source for central retinal artery occlusion requiring emergent intervention.
