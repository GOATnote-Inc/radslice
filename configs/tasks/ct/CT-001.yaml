reference_solution: |
  CTA of the left lower extremity demonstrates abrupt cutoff of contrast opacification within the left superficial femoral artery with absence of distal runoff in the popliteal and tibial vessels. There is reduced enhancement of the distal limb musculature consistent with ischemia. No abdominal aortic aneurysm identified. Findings are consistent with acute arterial occlusion, likely embolic in etiology.
