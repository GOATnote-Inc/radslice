reference_solution: |
  CT of the chest demonstrates bilateral ground-glass opacities with smooth interlobular septal thickening in a gravity-dependent and perihilar distribution, consistent with cardiogenic pulmonary edema. Cardiomegaly is present with a cardiothoracic ratio exceeding 0.5. Bilateral pleural effusions are noted, larger on the right. A dilated IVC and hepatic veins indicate elevated right-sided pressures. No focal consolidation to suggest pneumonia. Findings are consistent with acute decompensated heart failure with pulmonary edema.
