reference_solution: |
  Non-contrast CT head demonstrates diffuse cerebral edema with effacement of cortical sulci and basal cisterns. There is diffuse loss of gray-white matter differentiation throughout both cerebral hemispheres. Scattered small hypodense foci in the white matter may represent microinfarcts from parasitized erythrocyte sequestration. No intracranial hemorrhage or hydrocephalus is identified. In a patient with known Plasmodium falciparum infection and altered mental status, findings are consistent with cerebral malaria.
