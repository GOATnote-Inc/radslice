reference_solution: |
  Contrast-enhanced CT of the right lower extremity demonstrates gas tracking along the deep fascial planes of the thigh and calf with thickening and non-enhancement of the deep fascia, consistent with fascial necrosis. Diffuse subcutaneous edema and fat stranding are present. The underlying muscles show heterogeneous enhancement suggesting early myonecrosis. No underlying osteomyelitis is identified. Findings are consistent with necrotizing fasciitis requiring emergent surgical debridement, broad-spectrum antibiotics, and ICU admission.
