reference_solution: |
  Contrast-enhanced CT of the chest and abdomen demonstrates circumferential wall thickening of the distal esophagus and gastric body with decreased mucosal enhancement, suggesting transmural injury (Zargar grade IIIa-IIIb). Periesophageal and perigastric fat stranding is present. No pneumomediastinum or pneumoperitoneum to suggest free perforation. The small bowel appears spared. Findings are consistent with severe caustic injury to the esophagus and stomach requiring ICU monitoring, endoscopic evaluation, and surgical consultation.
