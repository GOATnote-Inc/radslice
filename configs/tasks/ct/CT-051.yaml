reference_solution: |
  Multiphase contrast-enhanced CT of the abdomen demonstrates a 3.0 x 2.8 cm
  hypoattenuating mass in the pancreatic head, best seen on the pancreatic
  parenchymal phase where the mass fails to enhance compared to the
  surrounding normal pancreas. There is a double duct sign with dilatation of
  both the common bile duct (12 mm) and the main pancreatic duct (5 mm)
  upstream of the mass. The intrahepatic bile ducts are dilated. The
  gallbladder is distended (Courvoisier sign). The mass abuts the superior
  mesenteric vein along less than 180 degrees of its circumference without
  vessel occlusion or deformity. The superior mesenteric artery and celiac
  trunk are free of tumor contact. No hepatic metastases. No peritoneal
  carcinomatosis or ascites. No distant lymphadenopathy.
  Impression: Pancreatic head mass consistent with ductal adenocarcinoma with
  biliary obstruction (double duct sign). The mass appears borderline
  resectable given SMV abutment. Multidisciplinary oncology consultation
  recommended for staging and treatment planning. EUS with FNA for tissue
  confirmation.
