reference_solution: |
  CT of the abdomen demonstrates an elongated and thickened pyloric muscle with muscle thickness measuring approximately 4 mm and channel length of 18 mm, exceeding the diagnostic thresholds for hypertrophic pyloric stenosis. The stomach is distended with retained fluid content. No gastric mass or evidence of malrotation is identified. The proximal small bowel is decompressed. Findings are consistent with hypertrophic pyloric stenosis in this infant presenting with projectile non-bilious vomiting, requiring pyloromyotomy.
