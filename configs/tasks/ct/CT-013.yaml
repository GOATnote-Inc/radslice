reference_solution: |
  Contrast-enhanced CT of the head demonstrates expansion of the left cavernous sinus with a central filling defect consistent with thrombosis. The lateral wall of the left cavernous sinus is convex. There is associated left orbital proptosis and preseptal soft tissue swelling. No intracranial abscess is identified. In the setting of facial infection, findings are consistent with septic cavernous sinus thrombosis requiring emergent anticoagulation and intravenous antibiotics.
