reference_solution: |
  CT of the pelvis demonstrates a markedly distended urinary bladder with a volume estimated at over 1 liter. The prostate gland is enlarged with median lobe hypertrophy projecting into the bladder base. Mild bilateral hydroureteronephrosis is present secondary to the elevated intravesical pressure. No bladder wall mass or pelvic mass causing extrinsic compression is identified. Findings are consistent with acute urinary retention secondary to benign prostatic hyperplasia.
