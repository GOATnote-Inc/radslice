reference_solution: |
  CT of the lumbar spine demonstrates a broad-based disc herniation at the
  L4-L5 level with a central and left paracentral component measuring 6 mm
  in AP dimension. The herniation, in combination with bilateral ligamentum
  flavum hypertrophy (measuring up to 5 mm on each side) and facet joint
  arthrosis, results in severe central canal stenosis at this level. The
  AP diameter of the central canal is reduced to approximately 6 mm.
  Bilateral lateral recesses are narrowed. Bilateral neural foramina are
  mildly narrowed. No disc extrusion or free fragment. No
  spondylolisthesis. The remaining lumbar levels demonstrate mild
  degenerative changes without significant stenosis. Vertebral body heights
  are maintained without fracture.
  Impression: Severe lumbar spinal stenosis at L4-L5 due to a combination
  of disc herniation, ligamentum flavum hypertrophy, and facet arthrosis.
  Clinical correlation with symptoms recommended. MRI provides superior
  assessment of neural compression if surgical intervention is considered.
