reference_solution: |
  Contrast-enhanced CT of the chest demonstrates diffuse bilateral ground-glass opacities with interlobular septal thickening in a predominantly peripheral and gravity-dependent distribution. No filling defects are identified within the pulmonary arteries to suggest thromboembolism. No pleural effusions are noted. In the setting of recent long bone fracture, these findings are consistent with fat embolism syndrome. The pattern differs from typical ARDS by the presence of septal thickening and peripheral predominance.
