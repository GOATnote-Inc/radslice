reference_solution: |
  Contrast-enhanced CT of the thoracic spine demonstrates a rim-enhancing fluid collection in the posterior epidural space from T9 to T11, causing anterior displacement and compression of the thecal sac and spinal cord. Endplate irregularity and disc space narrowing at T10-T11 are consistent with associated vertebral osteomyelitis/discitis. No paraspinal abscess extension is identified. Findings are consistent with a spinal epidural abscess complicating vertebral osteomyelitis, requiring emergent MRI for further characterization and surgical decompression.
