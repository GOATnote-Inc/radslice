reference_solution: |
  Non-contrast CT head demonstrates a hypodense region within the left cerebellar hemisphere in the PICA territory with loss of gray-white matter differentiation, consistent with acute cerebellar infarction. There is mild effacement of the fourth ventricle without obstructive hydrocephalus. No cerebellar hemorrhage is identified. CTA should be evaluated for vertebral artery occlusion or dissection. In a patient presenting with acute vertigo, posterior circulation stroke must be excluded.
