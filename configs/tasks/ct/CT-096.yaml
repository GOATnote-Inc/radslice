reference_solution: |
  Non-contrast CT head demonstrates normal brain parenchyma with preserved gray-white matter differentiation. The ventricular system is normal in size and configuration without hydrocephalus. No intracranial mass, hemorrhage, or acute infarct is identified. The basal cisterns are patent. Bone windows show no fracture. CT is normal, which is expected in first-episode psychosis; however, MRI may be considered to further evaluate for subtle structural abnormalities or encephalitis if clinically indicated.
