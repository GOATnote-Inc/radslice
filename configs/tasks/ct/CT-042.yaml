reference_solution: |
  Non-contrast CT of the thoracic spine demonstrates a hyperdense biconvex
  epidural collection in the posterior epidural space extending from T10 to
  T12, measuring up to 8 mm in thickness. The collection has homogeneous
  high density (approximately 55-65 HU) consistent with acute hemorrhage.
  There is significant compression of the thoracic spinal cord at the T11
  level. The disc spaces at T10-T11 and T11-T12 are preserved without
  endplate erosion, distinguishing this from discitis-osteomyelitis with
  epidural abscess. The vertebral bodies are intact without fracture. No
  paraspinal soft tissue abnormality. The history of anticoagulation therapy
  provides clinical context for spontaneous epidural hemorrhage.
  Impression: Acute thoracic spinal epidural hematoma (T10-T12) with spinal
  cord compression at T11. No findings of infection or neoplasm.
  Emergent neurosurgical consultation for decompressive laminectomy and
  hematoma evacuation. Reversal of anticoagulation should be considered.
