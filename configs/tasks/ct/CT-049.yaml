reference_solution: |
  Non-contrast CT of the head demonstrates preserved gray-white matter
  differentiation throughout bilateral cerebral hemispheres. No intracranial
  hemorrhage, including no epidural, subdural, subarachnoid, or
  intraparenchymal blood. No acute territorial infarction. No mass lesion or
  mass effect. Midline structures are normal in position. The ventricles are
  mildly prominent with mild generalized cerebral volume loss, consistent
  with age-appropriate involutional changes. No focal lesion. The
  visualized paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are well aerated.
  Osseous structures are intact without fracture.
  Impression: Normal non-contrast head CT for age. No acute intracranial
  abnormality. Mild generalized cerebral volume loss is age-appropriate.
