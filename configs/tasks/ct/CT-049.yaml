reference_solution: |
  Contrast-enhanced CT of the bilateral thighs demonstrates diffuse enlargement and heterogeneous enhancement of the quadriceps and hamstring musculature bilaterally. Multiple hypodense areas within the muscles represent foci of necrosis. Subcutaneous edema and fascial thickening are present. No intramuscular abscess or subcutaneous gas is identified. In the clinical setting of elevated CK and myoglobinuria, findings are consistent with severe rhabdomyolysis requiring aggressive IV hydration and monitoring for acute kidney injury.
