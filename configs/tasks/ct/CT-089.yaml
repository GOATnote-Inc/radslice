reference_solution: |
  Contrast-enhanced CT of the abdomen demonstrates marked gallbladder wall thickening with pericholecystic fluid, a hallmark finding of dengue hemorrhagic fever. Bilateral pleural effusions and moderate ascites are present, indicating significant plasma leakage. Hepatosplenomegaly is noted. No hepatic or splenic infarction is identified. No active hemorrhage is present. In the clinical context of thrombocytopenia and positive dengue serology, findings are consistent with dengue hemorrhagic fever with plasma leakage requiring aggressive fluid management.
