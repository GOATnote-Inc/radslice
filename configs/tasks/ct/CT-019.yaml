reference_solution: |
  Contrast-enhanced CT of the abdomen and pelvis demonstrates marked wall
  thickening of the sigmoid colon with extensive pericolonic fat stranding.
  Multiple diverticula are present throughout the sigmoid colon. A 3.5 cm
  rim-enhancing fluid collection is identified in the left lower quadrant
  adjacent to the sigmoid colon, consistent with a pericolonic abscess. A
  small amount of free fluid is noted in the pelvis. No extraluminal free
  air to suggest frank perforation. No evidence of colonic obstruction. The
  affected segment of sigmoid measures approximately 8 cm in length. No
  suspicious colonic mass identified, though evaluation is limited due to
  inflammation. Modified Hinchey classification: Stage Ib (pericolonic
  abscess).
  Impression: Acute sigmoid diverticulitis complicated by a 3.5 cm
  pericolonic abscess (Hinchey Ib). Consideration of percutaneous drainage
  and intravenous antibiotics recommended.
