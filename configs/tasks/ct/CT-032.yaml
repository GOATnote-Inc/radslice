reference_solution: |
  Multiphase contrast-enhanced CT of the abdomen demonstrates a 3.2 cm
  well-circumscribed mass in segment 3 of the left hepatic lobe. The lesion
  shows homogeneous arterial phase hyperenhancement and becomes isodense to
  the surrounding liver parenchyma on portal venous and delayed phases
  without washout. A central hypodense scar is present on arterial and
  portal phases with progressive delayed enhancement of the scar, a
  characteristic finding of focal nodular hyperplasia. The background liver
  is normal in morphology without cirrhosis. No pseudocapsule is identified.
  No portal vein thrombosis. The remaining liver parenchyma is homogeneous
  without additional lesions. No biliary dilatation.
  Impression: Left hepatic lobe lesion with imaging characteristics
  diagnostic of focal nodular hyperplasia (central scar with delayed
  enhancement, arterial hyperenhancement without washout, non-cirrhotic
  liver). No further workup necessary if diagnosis is confident on
  multiphase imaging.
