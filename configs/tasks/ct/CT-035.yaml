reference_solution: |
  Contrast-enhanced CT of the abdomen demonstrates gallbladder distension with diffuse wall thickening and hyperenhancement. Pericholecystic fat stranding and a small amount of pericholecystic fluid are present. A hyperdense gallstone is impacted in the gallbladder neck. There is no gallbladder perforation, abscess, or biliary ductal dilatation. Findings are consistent with acute calculous cholecystitis.
