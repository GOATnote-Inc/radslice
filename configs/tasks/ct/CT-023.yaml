reference_solution: |
  Contrast-enhanced CT of the chest demonstrates dense lobar consolidation
  involving the entirety of the right lower lobe with patent air
  bronchograms, consistent with lobar pneumonia. A moderate right-sided
  pleural effusion is present, layering dependently in the posterior costophrenic
  recess. The effusion measures approximately 3 cm in maximal depth. The
  visceral and parietal pleura show smooth enhancement without the split
  pleura sign, suggesting simple parapneumonic effusion rather than empyema.
  Small reactive lymph nodes are present in the subcarinal station. No
  cavitation or abscess formation within the consolidated lung. The
  remaining lung parenchyma is clear. No endobronchial lesion identified.
  No pericardial effusion. The left lung is clear.
  Impression: Right lower lobe lobar pneumonia with moderate parapneumonic
  pleural effusion. Clinical correlation with inflammatory markers and
  consideration of thoracentesis if effusion does not respond to antibiotic
  therapy.
