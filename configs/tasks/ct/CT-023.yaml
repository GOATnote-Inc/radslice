reference_solution: |
  Contrast-enhanced CT of the chest demonstrates a wound tract traversing the left anterolateral chest wall into the left thoracic cavity with an associated pulmonary laceration of the left lower lobe. A moderate left hemopneumothorax is present. No active contrast extravasation is identified. The mediastinal great vessels appear intact. No diaphragmatic injury is identified. Findings are consistent with penetrating thoracic injury requiring chest tube placement and surgical evaluation.
