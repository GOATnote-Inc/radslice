reference_solution: |
  CTA of the chest demonstrates a hypertrophied and tortuous right bronchial artery with a focus of active contrast extravasation, identified as the source of hemorrhage. Dense consolidation is present in the right lower lobe representing intrapulmonary hemorrhage. Blood products are noted within the trachea and bilateral mainstem bronchi. No pulmonary artery pseudoaneurysm is identified. Findings confirm massive hemoptysis with a bronchial arterial source amenable to emergent bronchial artery embolization.
