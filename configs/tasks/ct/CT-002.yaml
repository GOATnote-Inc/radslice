reference_solution: |
  CTA of the chest demonstrates an intimal flap within the ascending aorta extending through the aortic arch and into the descending thoracic aorta, separating true and false lumens with differential contrast opacification. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. No pericardial effusion is identified. Findings are consistent with Stanford type A aortic dissection requiring emergent surgical consultation.
