reference_solution: |
  CT pulmonary angiography demonstrates acute filling defects within the
  right main pulmonary artery extending into the right lower lobe segmental
  branches, consistent with acute pulmonary embolism. The thrombus is
  partially occlusive in the right main pulmonary artery and near-occlusive
  in the segmental branches. The RV/LV diameter ratio is approximately 1.3,
  suggesting right heart strain. There is mild bowing of the interventricular
  septum toward the left ventricle. No left-sided pulmonary embolism is
  identified. No pleural effusion or pulmonary infarction. No aortic
  dissection.
  Impression: Acute right-sided pulmonary embolism with evidence of right
  heart strain. Findings suggest submassive PE warranting consideration of
  escalated therapy.
