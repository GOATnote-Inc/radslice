reference_solution: |
  Non-contrast CT head demonstrates subtle loss of gray-white matter differentiation in the left insular cortex and left lentiform nucleus with early sulcal effacement in the left frontoparietal region. A hyperdense left MCA sign is present at the M1 segment. No intracranial hemorrhage is identified. ASPECTS score is estimated at 8. Findings are consistent with acute left MCA territory ischemic stroke with proximal M1 occlusion.
