reference_solution: |
  CT of the right upper extremity demonstrates heterogeneous enhancement of the deep musculature of the right arm and forearm with multiple areas of non-enhancement consistent with deep tissue necrosis along the path of electrical current. Diffuse subcutaneous and fascial edema is present. Focal thrombosis of the right brachial artery is noted. No osseous fracture is identified. Findings are consistent with deep tissue injury from high-voltage electrical injury with extent of necrosis exceeding the apparent surface burns.
