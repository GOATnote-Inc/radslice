reference_solution: |
  Contrast-enhanced CT of the chest demonstrates a large loculated
  right-sided pleural collection with enhancing, thickened visceral and
  parietal pleural layers separated by the collection — the classic split
  pleura sign — highly suggestive of empyema. The collection measures
  approximately 12 x 6 cm and contains internal septations. The enhanced
  pleural surfaces measure up to 3 mm in thickness. There is adjacent
  compressive atelectasis of the right lower lobe. The collection has
  higher attenuation (approximately 20 HU) than simple transudative
  effusion. No pleural nodularity or mass to suggest malignancy. No
  bronchopleural fistula or pneumothorax. The left hemithorax is clear.
  Impression: Right-sided empyema with split pleura sign and internal
  septations. Chest tube drainage or video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery
  (VATS) debridement recommended. Infectious disease consultation for
  targeted antibiotic therapy.
