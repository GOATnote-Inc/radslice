reference_solution: |
  CTPA demonstrates extensive bilateral filling defects within the main, lobar, and segmental pulmonary arteries consistent with acute pulmonary embolism. The right ventricle is dilated with an RV/LV ratio of approximately 1.3, and the interventricular septum bows toward the left ventricle, indicating right heart strain. No pulmonary infarction is identified. Findings represent acute bilateral pulmonary embolism with signs of right heart strain consistent with submassive PE.
