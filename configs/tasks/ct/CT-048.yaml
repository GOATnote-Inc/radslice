reference_solution: |
  CT of the right lower extremity demonstrates a comminuted displaced fracture of the mid tibial diaphysis with associated fibular fracture. There is a large overlying anterior soft tissue defect communicating with the fracture site, confirming an open fracture. Subcutaneous and intramuscular air is present at the fracture site. No vascular injury is identified on CT angiography. Findings are consistent with a Gustilo type IIIA open tibial fracture requiring emergent surgical debridement, irrigation, and fixation.
