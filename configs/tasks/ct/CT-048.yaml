reference_solution: |
  Multiphase contrast-enhanced CT of the abdomen demonstrates a large
  heterogeneously enhancing solid mass arising from the upper pole of the
  left kidney, measuring 7.2 x 6.5 x 6.0 cm. The mass shows avid
  corticomedullary phase enhancement with central areas of necrosis. No
  macroscopic fat is identified within the mass, arguing against
  angiomyolipoma. Tumor thrombus is present extending from the mass into
  the left renal vein, with expansion of the vein to 2.2 cm in diameter.
  The thrombus approaches but does not extend into the inferior vena cava.
  The right kidney is normal. No retroperitoneal or para-aortic
  lymphadenopathy exceeding 1 cm. The bilateral adrenal glands are normal.
  Visualized lung bases are clear without metastatic nodules.
  Impression: Large left upper pole renal mass consistent with renal cell
  carcinoma (T3a) with left renal vein tumor thrombus. No IVC extension.
  No distant metastases on this study. Urologic oncology referral for
  surgical planning. Complete staging with chest CT recommended.
