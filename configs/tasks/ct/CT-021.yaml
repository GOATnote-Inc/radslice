reference_solution: |
  CTA of the abdomen demonstrates a complex laceration of the right hepatic lobe (AAST grade IV) with a focus of active contrast extravasation indicating ongoing arterial hemorrhage. Large volume hemoperitoneum is present throughout the peritoneal cavity. The IVC is collapsed, consistent with hypovolemic shock. The spleen, kidneys, and bowel appear intact. Findings require emergent surgical or interventional radiology consultation for hemorrhage control.
