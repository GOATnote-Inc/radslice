reference_solution: |
  Non-contrast CT of the head demonstrates marked dilatation of the bilateral
  lateral ventricles and third ventricle with the fourth ventricle being
  normal in size, indicating obstructive hydrocephalus at the level of the
  aqueduct of Sylvius. The temporal horns are prominently dilated bilaterally.
  There is periventricular hypodensity consistent with transependymal CSF
  flow, an indicator of acute hydrocephalus. The cerebral sulci are effaced
  rather than widened, supporting a diagnosis of hydrocephalus rather than
  atrophy. No intracranial hemorrhage is identified. No obvious mass lesion
  on this non-contrast study, though MRI is recommended for further
  evaluation of the aqueductal region.
  Impression: Obstructive hydrocephalus with aqueductal level obstruction and
  transependymal CSF flow suggesting acute-on-chronic process. MRI
  recommended for etiology. Neurosurgical consultation for potential CSF
  diversion.
