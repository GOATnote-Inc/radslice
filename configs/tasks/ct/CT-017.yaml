reference_solution: |
  Non-contrast CT head demonstrates a hyperdense crescentic extra-axial collection along the right frontoparietal convexity measuring up to 12 mm in maximal thickness, consistent with acute subdural hematoma. There is approximately 8 mm of leftward midline shift with effacement of the right lateral ventricle and subfalcine herniation. No underlying skull fracture is identified. Findings represent an acute subdural hematoma with significant mass effect requiring emergent neurosurgical evaluation.
