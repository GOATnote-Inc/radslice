reference_solution: |
  CTA of the chest demonstrates a focal pseudoaneurysm at the aortic isthmus just distal to the origin of the left subclavian artery with an intimal flap and irregular aortic contour, consistent with traumatic aortic transection. There is a surrounding periaortic mediastinal hematoma and a moderate left hemothorax. No injury to the aortic root is identified. Findings represent a grade III traumatic aortic injury requiring emergent endovascular or surgical repair.
