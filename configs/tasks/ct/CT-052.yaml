reference_solution: |
  Contrast-enhanced CT of the abdomen demonstrates a large subcapsular hematoma along the right hepatic lobe with peripheral crescentic high-attenuation material compressing the underlying liver parenchyma. Heterogeneous enhancement of the right hepatic lobe is present with patchy areas of non-enhancement suggesting hepatic infarction. Periportal edema is noted. No free hepatic rupture or active contrast extravasation is identified. In a pregnant patient with preeclampsia, findings are consistent with HELLP syndrome complicated by subcapsular hepatic hematoma.
