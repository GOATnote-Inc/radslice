reference_solution: |
  Non-contrast CT of the abdomen demonstrates diffuse pancreatic parenchymal
  and intraductal calcifications throughout the body and tail of the
  pancreas, consistent with chronic calcific pancreatitis. The main
  pancreatic duct is irregularly dilated with alternating segments of
  dilatation and stricture creating a chain of lakes appearance. The
  pancreatic parenchyma is atrophic, particularly in the body and tail.
  Importantly, no discrete hypodense mass is identified to suggest
  superimposed malignancy, though CT sensitivity for mass detection in the
  setting of chronic pancreatitis is limited. The common bile duct is normal
  in caliber without biliary obstruction. No peripancreatic
  lymphadenopathy. No vascular encasement. No ascites.
  Impression: Chronic calcific pancreatitis with ductal dilatation and
  parenchymal atrophy. No discrete mass identified, though MRI/MRCP and
  clinical follow-up recommended given increased malignancy risk in chronic
  pancreatitis. EUS may be considered if clinical suspicion persists.
