reference_solution: |
  Coronary CTA demonstrates fusiform aneurysmal dilatation of the proximal left anterior descending artery measuring approximately 6 mm in diameter and a separate fusiform aneurysm of the proximal right coronary artery measuring 5 mm. A small mural thrombus is noted within the LAD aneurysm. No coronary artery stenosis is identified. The remaining coronary segments are normal in caliber. In a child with recent febrile mucocutaneous illness, findings are consistent with coronary artery aneurysms from Kawasaki disease requiring aspirin, IVIG, and serial imaging surveillance.
