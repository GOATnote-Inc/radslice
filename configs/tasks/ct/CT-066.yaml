reference_solution: |
  CT of the temporal bones demonstrates erosion of the inferior wall of the right external auditory canal with soft tissue filling the canal and extending into the right infratemporal fossa. Osseous destruction involves the right petrous apex with extension toward the clivus. No intracranial abscess or dural enhancement is identified. In a diabetic patient with chronic ear pain and granulation tissue, findings are consistent with malignant (necrotizing) otitis externa with skull base osteomyelitis requiring prolonged IV antibiotics.
