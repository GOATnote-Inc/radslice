reference_solution: |
  Non-contrast CT head demonstrates diffuse cerebral edema with effacement of the cortical sulci and basal cisterns. There is diffuse loss of gray-white matter differentiation throughout both cerebral hemispheres and bilateral cerebellar hemispheres. No intracranial hemorrhage or focal mass lesion is identified. In the setting of severe hyperthermia (core temperature > 40 degrees C) and altered mental status, findings are consistent with heat stroke with cerebral edema requiring emergent cooling measures and neuroprotective care.
