reference_solution: |
  Contrast-enhanced CT of the chest demonstrates pneumomediastinum with extraluminal air tracking along the distal esophagus in the posterior mediastinum. A periesophageal fluid collection is present at the distal esophagus with an associated left hydropneumothorax. No aortic injury is identified. Oral contrast, if administered, may demonstrate extravasation at the site of perforation. Findings are consistent with esophageal perforation (Boerhaave syndrome) requiring emergent surgical consultation.
