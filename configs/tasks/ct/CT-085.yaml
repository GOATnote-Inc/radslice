reference_solution: |
  CT of the orbits demonstrates a large retrobulbar hemorrhage within the left intraconal space causing marked proptosis. The posterior globe demonstrates tenting with stretching of the left optic nerve, indicating elevated intraorbital pressure. An associated left orbital floor fracture is present. No globe rupture is identified. Findings represent orbital compartment syndrome requiring emergent lateral canthotomy and cantholysis to decompress the orbit and preserve vision.
