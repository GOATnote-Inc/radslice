reference_solution: |
  CT of the chest demonstrates a hyperdense foreign body lodged within the mid esophageal lumen at the level of the aortic arch, the most common site of esophageal impaction. There is proximal esophageal dilatation with retained fluid. No pneumomediastinum, extraluminal air, or periesophageal fluid collection is identified to suggest perforation. Findings confirm esophageal foreign body impaction requiring endoscopic removal.
