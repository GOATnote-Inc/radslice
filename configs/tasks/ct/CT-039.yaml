reference_solution: |
  CT of the chest performed in the trauma setting demonstrates non-segmental
  areas of ground-glass opacity and patchy consolidation in the right lower
  lobe and right middle lobe, consistent with pulmonary contusion in the
  appropriate clinical context. Multiple acute displaced fractures are
  identified involving the right 5th through 8th ribs along the posterior
  and lateral arcs. A small anterior right pneumothorax is present. Mild
  right-sided subcutaneous emphysema is noted in the chest wall. No flail
  segment (each fractured rib has a single fracture line). The left lung is
  clear. The aorta and great vessels appear intact. No hemothorax. No
  diaphragmatic injury.
  Impression: Right-sided pulmonary contusion with multiple right rib
  fractures (5th through 8th), small right pneumothorax, and subcutaneous
  emphysema. Recommend serial imaging and pain management with incentive
  spirometry to prevent secondary complications.
