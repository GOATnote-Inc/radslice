reference_solution: |
  CTA of the abdomen and pelvis demonstrates a focus of active contrast extravasation within the sigmoid colon, indicating active arterial hemorrhage. High-attenuation intraluminal material is present in the distal colon and rectum, representing blood products. Extensive diverticulosis of the sigmoid colon is noted, likely representing the etiology. No colonic mass lesion is identified. Findings confirm active lower GI hemorrhage from the sigmoid colon amenable to angiographic embolization or surgical intervention.
