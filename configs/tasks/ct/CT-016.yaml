reference_solution: |
  Contrast-enhanced CT angiography of the abdomen demonstrates a large
  fusiform infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm measuring 7.8 cm in maximal
  diameter. There is a large left retroperitoneal hematoma extending from the
  periaortic space into the left psoas muscle and pararenal space, consistent
  with aneurysm rupture. Active contrast extravasation is identified along
  the posterior wall of the aneurysm. Eccentric mural thrombus lines the
  aneurysm sac. The aneurysm extends to the aortic bifurcation but the
  common iliac arteries are normal in caliber. The renal arteries arise above
  the aneurysm neck. No aortic dissection flap. No free intraperitoneal
  rupture.
  Impression: Ruptured infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm with large left
  retroperitoneal hematoma and active extravasation. Emergent vascular
  surgical repair required. This is a life-threatening emergency.
