reference_solution: |
  Contrast-enhanced CT of the abdomen demonstrates a striated nephrogram of the left kidney with multiple wedge-shaped areas of decreased cortical enhancement radiating from the papillae to the cortical surface. The left kidney is mildly enlarged with perinephric fat stranding. No renal abscess or obstructing ureteral calculus is identified. The right kidney enhances normally. Findings are consistent with acute left pyelonephritis.
