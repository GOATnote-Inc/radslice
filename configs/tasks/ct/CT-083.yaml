reference_solution: |
  Contrast-enhanced CT of the extremities and abdomen demonstrates diffuse edema and heterogeneous enhancement of the bilateral lower extremity musculature with areas of non-enhancement consistent with myonecrosis from prolonged crush injury. The bilateral kidneys are enlarged with a striated nephrogram pattern consistent with acute tubular necrosis from myoglobinuric renal failure. No vascular occlusion is identified. Findings are consistent with crush syndrome with rhabdomyolysis and acute kidney injury requiring aggressive fluid resuscitation and renal replacement therapy.
