reference_solution: |
  Contrast-enhanced CT of the pelvis demonstrates an enlarged right ovary measuring approximately 6 cm with peripheral displacement of follicles and central stromal edema. The uterus is deviated toward the right. Decreased enhancement of the right ovary is noted compared with the normal left ovary. The twisted right adnexal pedicle demonstrates a whirlpool sign. No free pelvic fluid is identified. Findings are consistent with right ovarian torsion requiring emergent surgical intervention for ovarian salvage.
