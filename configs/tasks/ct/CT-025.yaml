reference_solution: |
  Non-contrast CT head demonstrates multiple bilateral hemorrhagic contusions involving the frontal and temporal lobes with surrounding edema. Traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage is present along the bilateral cerebral convexities. There is diffuse cerebral edema with loss of gray-white matter differentiation and effacement of the basal cisterns, suggesting raised intracranial pressure. No depressed skull fracture is identified. Findings represent severe traumatic brain injury requiring emergent neurosurgical consultation and ICP monitoring.
