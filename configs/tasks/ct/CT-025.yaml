reference_solution: |
  CT of the thoracolumbar spine demonstrates a comminuted burst fracture of
  the L1 vertebral body. There is significant loss of vertebral body height,
  approximately 40% anteriorly. A retropulsed posterior vertebral body
  fragment is displaced into the anterior spinal canal, causing
  approximately 30% canal compromise. Fracture lines extend through both the
  anterior and posterior cortex of the vertebral body. There is a
  non-displaced fracture of the right L1 lamina, indicating three-column
  involvement (Denis classification). The adjacent vertebral bodies at T12
  and L2 appear intact without fracture. The aorta is normal without
  traumatic injury. No preexisting lytic lesion to suggest pathologic
  etiology.
  Impression: L1 burst fracture with retropulsed fragment causing 30%
  spinal canal compromise and three-column involvement. Mechanically
  unstable injury. Emergent spine surgery consultation for stabilization.
  MRI recommended for spinal cord assessment.
