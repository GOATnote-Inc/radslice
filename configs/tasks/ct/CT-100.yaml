reference_solution: |
  Contrast-enhanced CT of the lumbar spine demonstrates smooth enhancement and thickening of the cauda equina nerve roots, particularly involving the anterior (motor) roots. No compressive disc herniation, epidural mass, or spinal cord abnormality is identified. The enhancement pattern is bilateral and symmetric. No leptomeningeal nodularity to suggest carcinomatosis. In the clinical context of ascending weakness and areflexia, findings support the diagnosis of Guillain-Barre syndrome. MRI is recommended for more detailed evaluation, and CSF analysis for albuminocytologic dissociation.
