reference_solution: |
  Coronary CTA demonstrates smooth long-segment eccentric luminal narrowing of the mid left anterior descending artery with a surrounding crescent of intramural hematoma. There is no significant coronary calcification or atherosclerotic plaque at the affected segment. The remaining coronary arteries are patent. Findings are characteristic of spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD), most commonly seen in young female patients.
