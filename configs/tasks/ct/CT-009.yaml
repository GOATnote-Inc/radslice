reference_solution: |
  Contrast-enhanced CT of the chest demonstrates marked cardiomegaly with four-chamber dilatation. There is diffuse bilateral pulmonary edema manifesting as ground-glass opacification and smooth interlobular septal thickening. Small bilateral pleural effusions are noted. No pericardial effusion or aortic dissection identified. In the setting of hemodynamically unstable bradycardia, findings are consistent with cardiogenic pulmonary edema secondary to low cardiac output.
