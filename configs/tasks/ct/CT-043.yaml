reference_solution: |
  Contrast-enhanced CT of the abdomen demonstrates a distended gallbladder
  with diffuse wall thickening measuring up to 5 mm with mural
  hyperenhancement. Multiple hyperdense gallstones are present, with the
  largest impacted at the gallbladder neck measuring 12 mm. There is
  pericholecystic fat stranding and a thin rim of pericholecystic fluid in
  the gallbladder fossa. The common bile duct measures 5 mm without
  dilatation and no intraductal stones are identified. The intrahepatic bile
  ducts are not dilated. No gallbladder perforation or emphysematous change
  (no intramural gas). No hepatic abscess. A positive sonographic Murphy
  sign equivalent is suspected given the degree of local inflammation.
  Impression: Acute calculous cholecystitis with impacted gallstone at the
  gallbladder neck, gallbladder wall thickening, and pericholecystic
  inflammation. Surgical consultation for cholecystectomy recommended.
