reference_solution: |
  CT of the chest demonstrates bilateral perihilar and basal ground-glass opacities and consolidation in a butterfly pattern, characteristic of primary blast lung injury from overpressure wave. Bilateral pneumothoraces and pneumomediastinum are present, consistent with barotrauma. Multiple rib fractures are noted from secondary blast injury. No aortic injury is identified. Findings represent primary blast lung injury requiring careful ventilatory management with low tidal volumes to avoid further barotrauma.
