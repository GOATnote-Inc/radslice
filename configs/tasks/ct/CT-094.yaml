reference_solution: |
  Contrast-enhanced CT of the abdomen demonstrates diffuse subcutaneous edema, mesenteric edema, and diffuse bowel wall thickening consistent with capillary leak syndrome. Bilateral pleural effusions and moderate ascites are present. No focal abscess or source of infection is identified on imaging. The IVC is collapsed, consistent with distributive shock and intravascular depletion. In the setting of erythroderma, fever, and hypotension, findings are consistent with toxic shock syndrome with diffuse third-spacing requiring aggressive fluid resuscitation and source-directed antibiotics.
