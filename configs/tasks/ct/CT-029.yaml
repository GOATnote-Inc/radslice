reference_solution: |
  CT of the chest demonstrates dense airspace consolidation within the right lower lobe with air bronchograms, consistent with lobar pneumonia. There is adjacent ground-glass opacity at the periphery of the consolidation and a small right pleural effusion. No cavitation or endobronchial mass is identified. Findings are most consistent with community-acquired pneumonia.
