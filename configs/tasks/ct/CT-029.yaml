reference_solution: |
  Contrast-enhanced CT of the abdomen demonstrates a 5.8 cm rim-enhancing
  hypodense lesion in the right hepatic lobe (segments 6/7) with a double
  target sign — an inner enhancing rim and an outer zone of perilesional
  edema — characteristic of a pyogenic liver abscess. The lesion contains
  internal low-attenuation fluid and scattered foci of gas. Several smaller
  satellite lesions coalesce around the dominant collection, forming a
  cluster sign. There is no biliary dilatation to suggest ascending
  cholangitis as the etiology. The portal vein and hepatic veins are patent.
  No additional hepatic lesions to suggest metastatic disease. No free
  peritoneal fluid.
  Impression: Right hepatic lobe pyogenic abscess with cluster sign and
  internal gas, measuring 5.8 cm. Percutaneous drainage and targeted
  antibiotic therapy recommended. Blood cultures and evaluation for
  underlying etiology (biliary, portal, or cryptogenic) advised.
