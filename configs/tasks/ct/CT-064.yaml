reference_solution: |
  Contrast-enhanced CT of the head demonstrates hypodensity and swelling of the left medial temporal lobe extending into the insular cortex with effacement of the adjacent Sylvian fissure. Patchy gyral enhancement is present in the affected region. Subtle foci of petechial hemorrhage are seen within the edematous temporal lobe. No ring-enhancing lesion is identified. Findings are characteristic of herpes simplex encephalitis with a strong predilection for the temporal and insular cortex. MRI and empiric acyclovir are recommended emergently.
