reference_solution: |
  CT of the temporal bones demonstrates complete opacification of the right mastoid air cells with erosion of the bony septa between air cells, consistent with coalescent mastoiditis. There is cortical erosion of the posterolateral mastoid with a small subperiosteal soft tissue collection. The sigmoid sinus plate is intact and no intracranial complication is identified. The left mastoid is normally pneumatized. Findings are consistent with acute coalescent mastoiditis requiring IV antibiotics and likely mastoidectomy.
