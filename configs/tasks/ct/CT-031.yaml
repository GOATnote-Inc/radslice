reference_solution: |
  CT of the chest demonstrates a moderate left-sided pneumothorax with partial collapse of the left lung. A small apical bleb is identified at the left lung apex, likely representing the etiology. There is no mediastinal shift to suggest tension physiology. The right lung is fully expanded and clear. Findings are consistent with primary spontaneous pneumothorax, likely secondary to ruptured apical bleb.
